"QI X;XIAO R;LI C;QIAO Y;GUO J;TANG X";PAIRWISE ROTATION INVARIANT COOCCURRENCE LOCAL BINARY PATTERN;DESIGNING EFFECTIVE FEATURES IS A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IN COMPUTER VISION. HOWEVER, IT IS USUALLY DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE A GREAT TRADEOFF BETWEEN DISCRIMINATIVE POWER AND ROBUSTNESS. PREVIOUS WORKS SHOWN THAT SPATIAL CO-OCCURRENCE CAN BOOST THE DISCRIMINATIVE POWER OF FEATURES. HOWEVER THE CURRENT EXISTING CO-OCCURRENCE FEATURES ARE TAKING FEW CONSIDERATIONS TO THE ROBUSTNESS AND HENCE SUFFERING FROM SENSITIVITY TO GEOMETRIC AND PHOTOMETRIC VARIATIONS. IN THIS WORK, WE STUDY THE TRANSFORM INVARIANCE (TI) OF CO-OCCURRENCE FEATURES. CONCRETELY WE FORMALLY INTRODUCE A PAIRWISE TRANSFORM INVARIANCE (PTI) PRINCIPLE, AND THEN PROPOSE A NOVEL PAIRWISE ROTATION INVARIANT CO-OCCURRENCE LOCAL BINARY PATTERN (PRICOLBP) FEATURE, AND FURTHER EXTEND IT TO INCORPORATE MULTI-SCALE, MULTI-ORIENTATION, AND MULTI-CHANNEL INFORMATION. DIFFERENT FROM OTHER LBP VARIANTS, PRICOLBP CAN NOT ONLY CAPTURE THE SPATIAL CONTEXT CO-OCCURRENCE INFORMATION EFFECTIVELY, BUT ALSO POSSESS ROTATION INVARIANCE. WE EVALUATE PRICOLBP COMPREHENSIVELY ON NINE BENCHMARK DATA SETS FROM FIVE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES, E.G., ENCODING STRATEGY, ROTATION INVARIANCE, THE NUMBER OF TEMPLATES, SPEED, AND DISCRIMINATIVE POWER COMPARED TO OTHER LBP VARIANTS. FURTHERMORE WE APPLY PRICOLBP TO SIX DIFFERENT BUT RELATED APPLICATIONS - TEXTURE, MATERIAL, FLOWER, LEAF, FOOD, AND SCENE CLASSIFICATION, AND DEMONSTRATE THAT PRICOLBP IS EFFICIENT, EFFECTIVE, AND OF A WELL-BALANCED TRADEOFF BETWEEN THE DISCRIMINATIVE POWER AND ROBUSTNESS.

"KORPELA I;POLVIVAARA A;HOVI A;JUNTTILA S;HOLOPAINEN M";INFLUENCE OF PHENOLOGY ON WAVEFORM FEATURES IN DECIDUOUS AND CONIFEROUS TREES IN AIRBORNE LIDAR;"INFORMATION ON FOREST STRUCTURE IS VITAL FOR SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT. CURRENTLY, AIRBORNE LIDAR REMOTE SENSING HAS BEEN WELL ESTABLISHED AS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO CHARACTERIZE THE STRUCTURE OF CANOPIES AND FOREST INVENTORY VARIABLES. RADIOMETRY AND GEOMETRY ARE HIGHLY INTERTWINED IN LIDAR REMOTE SENSING OF FOREST VEGETATION AND PHENOLOGY INFLUENCES THE GEOMETRIC-OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF DECIDUOUS AND EVERGREEN TREES CAUSING SEASONAL VARIATION IN LIDAR OBSERVATIONS. THIS VARIATION MAY BE CONSIDERED AS A NUISANCE OR EXPLOITED IN FOR EXAMPLE TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION. AIRBORNE LIDAR DATA ARE ALSO INFLUENCED BY SENSOR FUNCTIONING, ACQUISITION SETTINGS, SCAN GEOMETRY AND THE ATMOSPHERE. RELIABLE ESTIMATION OF SUBTLE PHENOLOGICAL EFFECTS CALLS FOR DATA IN WHICH THE IMPACT OF THE EXTERNAL FACTORS IS MINIMAL. WE EXPERIMENTED WITH SUCH DATA AND EXPLORED LIDAR WAVEFORMS (WFS) IN BOREAL TREES IN WINTER, EARLY SUMMER AND LATE SUMMER. OUR OBJECTIVES WERE TO I) ASSESS THE MATCH OF THE MULTITEMPORAL LIDAR DATA FOR OBSERVING TRUE CHANGES IN VEGETATION; II) QUANTIFY THE INFLUENCE OF PHENOLOGY IN DECIDUOUS AND EVERGREEN TREES; III) STUDY THE EFFECT OF VARYING SCAN ZENITH ANGLE (SZA) AND CANOPY AGE ON WF FEATURES IN DIFFERENT PHENOSTATES; IV) ASSESS THE TEMPORAL FEATURE CORRELATION IN INDIVIDUAL LIVING AND DEAD STANDING TREES. A WF-RECORDING PULSED LIDAR SENSOR UNIT OPERATING AT THE WAVELENGTH OF 1550 NM WAS USED IN REPEATED ACQUISITIONS. WF ATTRIBUTES SUCH AS ENERGY, PEAK AMPLITUDE AND ECHO WIDTH WERE DERIVED FOR EACH PULSE AND WERE LOCALIZED VERTICALLY TO CROWN, UNDERSTORY AND GROUND COMPONENTS. SILVER AND DOWNY BIRCH, BLACK ALDER, EUROPEAN ASPEN, SIBERIAN LARCH, SCOTS PINE, NORWAY SPRUCE AND DEAD STANDING SPRUCE FORMED OUR STRATA. RESULTS SHOWED THAT PHENOLOGY CAUSED MORE VARIATION IN WF FEATURES OF DECIDUOUS TREES COMPARED TO EVERGREEN CONIFERS. DECIDUOUS TREES DISPLAYED SUBSTANTIAL BETWEEN-SPECIES VARIATION THAT WAS LINKED WITH DIFFERENCES IN BRANCHING PATTERN, LEAF ORIENTATION AND BARK REFLECTANCE. PINE DISPLAYED A POSSIBLE WINTER-EARLY SUMMER ANOMALY IN CANOPY BACKSCATTERING THAT MAY BE LINKED WITH CHANGES IN FOLIAGE CLUMPING OR WITH THE ROLE OF STAMENS IN EARLY SUMMER TREES. TREES DISPLAYED POSITIVE TEMPORAL CORRELATION IN WF FEATURES AND CORRELATIONS WERE THE STRONGEST IN EVERGREEN AND DECIDUOUS CONIFERS AND DECREASED WITH TIME. SZA HAD MINOR INFLUENCE ON WF FEATURES WHEREAS AGE EXERCISED A STRONG EFFECT ON MANY FEATURES WITH PARALLEL VARIATION BETWEEN SPECIES AND PHENOSTATES. STRUCTURAL CHANGES FOLLOWING DEATH, I.E. â€˜AGINGâ€™ CHANGED THE GEOMETRIC WF FEATURES OF DEAD STANDING TREES. OUR RESULTS PROVIDE NEW INSIGHTS FOR ENHANCING TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION BY USING WF LIDAR AND FOR LIDAR TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS OF VEGETATION.

"PANT P;HEIKKINEN V;HOVI A;KORPELA I;HAUTA-KASARI M;TOKOLA T";EVALUATION OF SIMULATED BANDS IN AIRBORNE OPTICAL SENSORS FOR TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION;AIRBORNE MULTISPECTRAL REMOTE SENSING DEVICES HAVE BEEN USED IN AUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION OF TREE SPECIES, AND THE SPATIAL AND SPECTRAL PROPERTIES OF THE SENSORS AFFECT THE REMOTE SENSING MEASUREMENT RESULTS. PREVIOUS WORK BASED ON A SIMULATION MODEL WITH GROUND-LEVEL MEASURED REFLECTANCE DATA OF PINE (PINUS SYLVESTRIS L.), SPRUCE (PICEA ABIES (L.) H. KARST.), AND BIRCH (BETULA PUBESCENS EHRH. AND BETULA PENDULA ROTH) TREE SPECIES AND IDEALIZED LEICA ADS80 SENSITIVITIES SUGGESTED THAT THE ADDITION OF A FIFTH SENSITIVITY BAND IN THE RED EDGE WAVELENGTH REGION TO THE EXISTING LEICA ADS80 SYSTEM SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES THE CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE. IN THIS PAPER, WE EXTEND THIS ANALYSIS USING A SIMULATED MODEL WITH ACCURATE SPECTRAL SENSITIVITY INFORMATION AND AIRBORNE AISAEAGLE II HYPERSPECTRAL DATA FOR THESE THREE TREE SPECIES. WE SIMULATED MULTISPECTRAL RESPONSES USING SPECTRAL SENSITIVITY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LEICA ADS40, THE VEXCEL ULTRACAM-D, THE INTERGRAPH-Z/I DIGITAL MAPPING CAMERA AND THE LEICA ADS40 SYSTEM WITH AN ADDED BAND IN THE 691-785. NM REGION. WE EVALUATED THE TREE SPECIES CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE OF THESE SIMULATED RESPONSES USING DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE CLASSIFIERS. THE CLASSIFICATION EXPERIMENT RESULT SHOWED THAT THE SIMULATED RESPONSES OF THE 5-BAND MULTISPECTRAL SYSTEM YIELDED THE MOST ROBUST CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE WITH APPROXIMATELY 98% ACCURACY. THIS RESULT WAS SIMILAR TO THE ACCURACY OBTAINED WITH THE HYPERSPECTRAL DATA. ALTHOUGH DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN THE SENSITIVITY FUNCTIONS OF THE 4-BAND SYSTEMS, THERE WERE NO LARGE DIFFERENCES OBSERVED IN THE CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCES BETWEEN THEM. WITH THE SIMULATED 5-BAND SYSTEM, THERE WAS AN INCREASE OF 5-13% POINTS IN CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY WHEN COMPARED TO THE ACCURACIES OF THE 4-BAND SYSTEMS. THE RESULTS OBTAINED VIA PROPOSED 5-BAND SYSTEM SUPPORT RESULTS FROM PREVIOUS STUDIES SUGGESTING THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR A SENSITIVITY BAND IN THE RED EDGE WAVELENGTH REGION FOR APPLICATIONS IN TREE SPECIES CLASSIFICATION.

THE ABILITY TO MAP TREE SPECIES AND ANALYZE TREE HEALTH CONDITIONS WOULD BECOME VIVIDLY ESSENTIAL. REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES, ESPECIALLY HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGING, ARE BEING EVOLVED FOR SPECIES IDENTIFICATION AND VEGETATION MONITORING FROM SPECTRAL REPONSE PATTERNS. IN THIS STUDY, A HYPERSPECTRAL LIBRARY FOR URBAN TREE SPECIES IN HONG KONG WAS ESTABLISHED COMPRISING 75 URBAN TREES BELONGING TO 19 SPECIES. 450 BI-MONTHLY IMAGES WERE ACQUIRED BY A TERRESTRIAL HYPERSPECTRAL CAMERA (SPECIM-IQ) FROM NOVEMBER 2018 TO OCTOBER 2019. A DEEP NEURAL NETWORK CLASSIFICATION MODEL WAS DEVELOPED TO IDENTIFY TREE SPECIES FROM THE HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGERY WITH AN OVERALL ACCURACY RANGING FROM 85% TO 96% AMONG DIFFERENT SEASONS. REPRESENTATIVE SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE CURVES OF HEALTHY AND UNHEALTHY CONDITIONS FOR EACH SPECIES WERE EXTRACTED AND ANALYZED. THE HYPERSPECTRAL PHENOLOGY MODELS WERE DEVELOPED TO ACHIEVE HIGH ACCURACY AND OPTIMIZATION OF DATA ACQUISITION. THE BI-MONTHLY CANOPY SIGNATURES AND VEGETATION INDICES REVEALED DIFFERENT SEASONALITY PATTERNS OF EVERGREEN AND DECIDUOUS SPECIES IN HONG KONG. WE EXPLORED THE UTILITY OF TERRESTRIAL HYPERSPECTRAL REMOTE SENSING AND DEEP NEURAL NETWORK FOR URBAN TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZING. THIS PROVIDES A UNIQUE BASELINE TO UNDERSTAND HYPERSPECTRAL CHARACTERISTICS AND SEASONALITY OF URBAN TREE SPECIES IN HONG KONG THAT CAN ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGING AND DATABASE DEVELOPMENT ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD.

"BLOMLEY R;HOVI A;WEINMANN M;HINZ S;KORPELA I;JUTZI B";TREE SPECIES CLASSIFICATION USING WITHIN CROWN LOCALIZATION OF WAVEFORM LIDAR ATTRIBUTES;SINCE FOREST PLANNING IS INCREASINGLY TAKING AN ECOLOGICAL, DIVERSITY-ORIENTED PERSPECTIVE INTO ACCOUNT, REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGIES ARE BECOMING EVER MORE IMPORTANT IN ASSESSING EXISTING RESOURCES WITH REDUCED MANUAL EFFORT. WHILE THE LIGHT DETECTION AND RANGING (LIDAR) TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES A GOOD BASIS FOR PREDICTIONS OF TREE HEIGHT AND BIOMASS, TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION BASED ON THIS TYPE OF DATA IS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING IN STRUCTURALLY HETEROGENEOUS FORESTS. IN THIS PAPER, WE ANALYSE EXISTING APPROACHES WITH RESPECT TO THE GEOMETRICAL SCALE OF FEATURE EXTRACTION (WHOLE TREE, WITHIN CROWN PARTITIONS OR WITHIN LASER FOOTPRINT) AND CONCLUDE THAT CURRENTLY FEATURES ARE ALWAYS EXTRACTED SEPARATELY FROM THE DIFFERENT SCALES. SINCE MULTI-SCALE APPROACHES HOWEVER HAVE PROVEN SUCCESSFUL IN OTHER APPLICATIONS, WE AIM TO UTILIZE THE WITHIN-TREE-CROWN DISTRIBUTION OF WITHIN-FOOTPRINT SIGNAL CHARACTERISTICS AS ADDITIONAL FEATURES. TO DO SO, A SPIN IMAGE ALGORITHM, ORIGINALLY DEVISED FOR THE EXTRACTION OF 3D SURFACE FEATURES IN OBJECT RECOGNITION, IS ADAPTED. THIS ALGORITHM RELIES ON SPINNING AN IMAGE PLANE AROUND A DEFINED AXIS, E.G. THE TREE STEM, COLLECTING THE NUMBER OF LIDAR RETURNS OR MEAN VALUES OF RETURNS ATTRIBUTES PER PIXEL AS RESPECTIVE VALUES. BASED ON THIS REPRESENTATION, SPIN IMAGE FEATURES ARE EXTRACTED THAT COMPRISE ONLY THOSE COMPONENTS OF HIGHEST VARIABILITY AMONG A GIVEN SET OF LIBRARY TREES. THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE AND THE COMBINED IMPROVEMENT OF THESE SPIN IMAGE FEATURES WITH RESPECT TO NON-SPATIAL STATISTICAL METRICS OF THE WAVEFORM (WF) ATTRIBUTES ARE EVALUATED FOR THE TREE SPECIES CLASSIFICATION OF SCOTS PINE (PINUS SYLVESTRIS L.), NORWAY SPRUCE (PICEA ABIES (L.) KARST.) AND SILVER/DOWNY BIRCH (BETULA PENDULA ROTH/BETULA PUBESCENS EHRH.) IN A BOREAL FOREST ENVIRONMENT. THIS EVALUATION IS PERFORMED FOR TWO WF LIDAR DATASETS THAT DIFFER IN FOOTPRINT SIZE, PULSE DENSITY AT GROUND, LASER WAVELENGTH AND PULSE WIDTH. FURTHERMORE, WE EVALUATE THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE PROPOSED METHOD WITH RESPECT TO INTERNAL PARAMETERS AND TREE SIZE. THE RESULTS REVEAL, THAT THE CONSIDERATION OF THE CROWN-INTERNAL DISTRIBUTION OF WITHIN-FOOTPRINT SIGNAL CHARACTERISTICS CAPTURED IN SPIN IMAGE FEATURES IMPROVES THE CLASSIFICATION RESULTS IN NEARLY ALL TEST CASES.

A MACHINE VISION SYSTEM WAS DEVELOPED AND EQUIPPED WITH A CCD CAMERA INTEGRATED WITH A LINE-IMAGING SPECTROGRAPH FOR CLOSE-RANGE WEED SENSING AND MAPPING. THREE CANONICAL BAYESIAN CLASSIFIERS WERE DEVELOPED USING CANOPY REFLECTANCE (400-795. NM) COLLECTED OVER THREE SEASONS FOR TOMATO AND WEEDS. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE THREE SEASON-SPECIFIC CLASSIFIERS WAS TESTED BY CHANGING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN TOTAL ERROR RATE OF UP TO 36%. GLOBAL CALIBRATION ACROSS THE COMPLETE SPAN OF THE THREE SEASONS PRODUCED OVERALL CLASSIFICATION ACCURACIES OF 85.0%, 90.0% AND 92.7%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR 2005, 2006 AND 2008. TO IMPROVE THE STABILITY OF GLOBAL CLASSIFIER OVER MULTIPLE SEASONS, A MULTICLASSIFIER SYSTEM WAS CONSTRUCTED WITH THREE CANONICAL BAYESIAN CLASSIFIERS OPTIMIZED FOR THE THREE SEASONS INDIVIDUALLY. THIS SYSTEM WAS TESTED ON A DATA SET SIMULATING AN UPCOMING SEASON WITH FIELD CONDITIONS SIMILAR TO THAT IN 2005. THE SYSTEM INCREASED THE TOTAL DISCRIMINATION ACCURACY TO 95.8% FOR THE TESTED SEASON UNDER SIMULATION. THIS METHOD PROVIDED AN INNOVATIVE DIRECTION FOR ACHIEVING ROBUST PLANT RECOGNITION OVER MULTIPLE SEASONS BY INTEGRATING EXPERT KNOWLEDGE FROM HISTORICAL DATA THAT MOST CLOSELY MATCHED THE NEW FIELD ENVIRONMENT.

"LEE S;CHAN C;REMAGNINO P";MULTIORGAN PLANT CLASSIFICATION BASED ON CONVOLUTIONAL AND RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS;CLASSIFICATION OF PLANTS BASED ON A MULTI-ORGAN APPROACH IS VERY CHALLENGING. ALTHOUGH ADDITIONAL DATA PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION THAT MIGHT HELP TO DISAMBIGUATE BETWEEN SPECIES, THE VARIABILITY IN SHAPE AND APPEARANCE IN PLANT ORGANS ALSO RAISES THE DEGREE OF COMPLEXITY OF THE PROBLEM. DESPITE PROMISING SOLUTIONS BUILT USING DEEP LEARNING ENABLE REPRESENTATIVE FEATURES TO BE LEARNED FOR PLANT IMAGES, THE EXISTING APPROACHES FOCUS MAINLY ON GENERIC FEATURES FOR SPECIES CLASSIFICATION, DISREGARDING THE FEATURES REPRESENTING PLANT ORGANS. IN FACT, PLANTS ARE COMPLEX LIVING ORGANISMS SUSTAINED BY A NUMBER OF ORGAN SYSTEMS. IN OUR APPROACH, WE INTRODUCE A HYBRID GENERIC-ORGAN CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (HGO-CNN), WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT BOTH ORGAN AND GENERIC INFORMATION, COMBINING THEM USING A NEW FEATURE FUSION SCHEME FOR SPECIES CLASSIFICATION. NEXT, INSTEAD OF USING A CNN-BASED METHOD TO OPERATE ON ONE IMAGE WITH A SINGLE ORGAN, WE EXTEND OUR APPROACH.

RESEARCHERS HAVE RECENTLY BECOME MORE INCLINED TOWARD DEEP LEARNING-BASED METHODS RATHER THAN CONVENTIONAL FEATURE-BASED METHODS DUE TO THE POPULARITY AND SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF DEEP LEARNING METHODS IN IMAGE ANALYSIS, OBJECT RECOGNITION, AND SPEECH RECOGNITION. IN THIS PAPER, TO HAVE AN INTERPRETABLE AND RELIABLE SYSTEM, A BOTANIST'S BEHAVIOR IS MODELED IN LEAF IDENTIFICATION BY PROPOSING A HIGHLY-EFFICIENT METHOD OF MAXIMUM BEHAVIORAL RESEMBLANCE DEVELOPED THROUGH THREE DEEP LEARNING-BASED MODELS. DIFFERENT LAYERS OF THE THREE MODELS ARE VISUALIZED TO ENSURE THAT THE BOTANIST'S BEHAVIOR IS MODELED ACCURATELY. THE FIRST AND SECOND MODELS ARE DESIGNED FROM SCRATCH. REGARDING THE THIRD MODEL, THE PRE-TRAINED ARCHITECTURE MOBILENETV2 IS EMPLOYED ALONG WITH THE TRANSFER-LEARNING TECHNIQUE. THE PROPOSED METHOD IS EVALUATED ON TWO WELL-KNOWN DATASETS: FLAVIA AND MALAYAKEW. ACCORDING TO A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS, THE SUGGESTED APPROACH IS MORE ACCURATE THAN HAND-CRAFTED FEATURE EXTRACTION METHODS AND OTHER DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES IN TERMS OF 99.67% AND 99.81% ACCURACY. UNLIKE CONVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES THAT HAVE THEIR OWN SPECIFIC COMPLEXITIES AND DEPEND ON DATASETS, THE PROPOSED METHOD REQUIRES NO HAND-CRAFTED FEATURE EXTRACTION. ALSO, IT INCREASES ACCURACY AS COMPARED WITH OTHER DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES. MOREOVER, SWP-LEAFNET IS DISTRIBUTABLE AND CONSIDERABLY FASTER THAN OTHER METHODS BECAUSE OF USING SHALLOWER MODELS WITH FEWER PARAMETERS ASYNCHRONOUSLY.

"AB J M;HAMID S;SHUIB S;AHMAD I";LEAF FEATURES EXTRACTION AND RECOGNITION APPROACHES TO CLASSIFY PLANT;PLANT CLASSIFICATION BASED ON LEAF IDENTIFICATION IS BECOMING A POPULAR TREND. EACH LEAF CARRIES SUBSTANTIAL INFORMATION THAT CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY AND CLASSIFY THE ORIGIN OR THE TYPE OF PLANT. IN MEDICAL PERSPECTIVE, IMAGES HAVE BEEN USED BY DOCTORS TO DIAGNOSE DISEASES AND THIS METHOD HAS BEEN PROVEN RELIABLE FOR YEARS. USING THE SAME METHOD AS DOCTORS, RESEARCHERS TRY TO SIMULATE THE SAME PRINCIPLE TO RECOGNISE A PLANT USING HIGH QUALITY LEAF IMAGES AND COMPLEX MATHEMATICAL FORMULAE FOR COMPUTERS TO DECIDE THE ORIGIN AND TYPE OF PLANTS. THE EXPERIMENTS HAVE YIELDED MANY SUCCESS STORIES IN THE LAB, BUT SOME APPROACHES HAVE FAILED MISERABLY WHEN TESTED IN THE REAL WORLD. THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE RESEARCHERS MAY HAVE IGNORED THE FACTS THAT THE REAL WORLD SAMPLING MAY NOT HAVE THE LUXURY AND COMPLACENCY AS WHAT THEY MAY HAVE IN THE LAB. WHAT THIS STUDY INTENDS TO DELIVER IS THE IDEAL CASE APPROACH IN PLANT CLASSIFICATION AND RECOGNITION THAT NOT ONLY APPLICABLE IN THE REAL WORLD, BUT ALSO ACCEPTABLE IN THE LAB.

EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN OPTICAL IMAGING SENSORS PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PA. IN MAIZE FIELDS, SITE-SPECIFIC TREATMENTS, WITH CHEMICAL PRODUCTS OR MECHANICAL MANIPULATIONS, ARE APPLIED FOR WEEDS ELIMINATION. MAIZE IS AN IRRIGATED CROP, ALSO UNPROTECTED FROM RAINFALL. AFTER A STRONG RAIN, SOIL MATERIALS (PARTICULARLY CLAYS) MIXED WITH WATER IMPREGNATE THE VEGETATIVE COVER. THE GREEN SPECTRAL COMPONENT ASSOCIATED TO THE PLANTS IS MASKED BY THE DOMINANT RED SPECTRAL COMPONENT COMING FROM SOIL MATERIALS. THIS MAKES METHODS BASED ON THE GREENNESS IDENTIFICATION FAIL UNDER SUCH SITUATIONS. WE PROPOSE A NEW METHOD BASED ON SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES FOR IDENTIFYING PLANTS WITH GREEN SPECTRAL COMPONENTS MASKED AND UNMASKED. THE METHOD IS ALSO VALID FOR POST-TREATMENT EVALUATION, WHERE LOSS OF GREENNESS IN WEEDS IS IDENTIFIED WITH THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE TREATMENT AND IN CROPS WITH DAMAGE OR MASKING.

"GONÃ‡ALVES F;GUILHERME I;PEDRONETTE D";SEMANTIC GUIDED INTERACTIVE IMAGE RETRIEVAL FOR PLANT IDENTIFICATION;A LOT OF IMAGES ARE CURRENTLY GENERATED IN MANY DOMAINS, REQUIRING SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE OF IDENTIFICATION AND ANALYSIS. FROM ONE STANDPOINT, MANY ADVANCES HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF IMAGE RETRIEVAL TECHNIQUES BASED ON VISUAL IMAGE PROPERTIES. HOWEVER, THE SEMANTIC GAP BETWEEN LOW-LEVEL FEATURES AND HIGH-LEVEL CONCEPTS STILL REPRESENTS A CHALLENGING SCENARIO. ON ANOTHER STANDPOINT, KNOWLEDGE HAS ALSO BEEN STRUCTURED IN MANY FIELDS BY ONTOLOGIES. A PROMISING SOLUTION FOR BRIDGING THE SEMANTIC GAP CONSISTS IN COMBINING THE INFORMATION FROM LOW-LEVEL FEATURES WITH SEMANTIC KNOWLEDGE. THIS WORK PROPOSES A NOVEL GRAPH-BASED APPROACH DENOMINATED SEMANTIC INTERACTIVE IMAGE RETRIEVAL (SIIR) CAPABLE OF COMBINING CONTENT BASED IMAGE RETRIEVAL (CBIR), UNSUPERVISED LEARNING, ONTOLOGY TECHNIQUES AND INTERACTIVE RETRIEVAL. TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, THERE IS NO APPROACH IN THE LITERATURE THAT COMBINES THOSE DIVERSE TECHNIQUES LIKE SIIR. THE PROPOSED APPROACH SUPPORTS EXPERT IDENTIFICATION TASKS, SUCH AS THE BIOLOGIST'S ROLE IN PLANT IDENTIFICATION OF ANGIOSPERM FAMILIES. SINCE THE SYSTEM EXPLOITS INFORMATION FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES AS VISUAL CONTENT, ONTOLOGY, AND USER INTERACTIONS, THE USER EFFORTS REQUIRED ARE DRASTICALLY REDUCED. FOR THE SEMANTIC MODEL, WE DEVELOPED A DOMAIN ONTOLOGY WHICH REPRESENTS THE PLANT PROPERTIES AND STRUCTURES, RELATING FEATURES FROM ANGIOSPERM FAMILIES. A NOVEL GRAPH-BASED APPROACH IS PROPOSED FOR COMBINING THE SEMANTIC INFORMATION AND THE VISUAL RETRIEVAL RESULTS. A BIPARTITE AND A DISCRIMINATIVE ATTRIBUTE GRAPH ALLOW A SEMANTIC SELECTION OF THE MOST DISCRIMINATIVE ATTRIBUTES FOR PLANT IDENTIFICATION TASKS. THE SELECTED ATTRIBUTES ARE USED FOR FORMULATING A QUESTION TO THE USER. THE SYSTEM UPDATES SIMILARITY INFORMATION AMONG IMAGES BASED ON THE USER'S ANSWER, THUS IMPROVING THE RETRIEVAL EFFECTIVENESS AND REDUCING THE USER'S EFFORTS REQUIRED FOR IDENTIFICATION TASKS. THE PROPOSED METHOD WAS EVALUATED ON THE POPULAR OXFORD FLOWERS 17 AND 102 CLASSES DATASETS, YIELDING HIGHLY EFFECTIVE RESULTS IN BOTH DATASETS WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER APPROACHES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRST FIVE RETRIEVED IMAGES FOR 17 CLASSES ACHIEVE A RETRIEVAL PRECISION OF 97.07% AND FOR 102 CLASSES, 91.33%.

THE PROBLEM OF THIS APPROACH IS THAT EACH OUTPUT UNIT REQUIRES A COMPLEX DECISION BOUNDARY TO SEPARATE EXAMPLES FROM ONE CLASS FROM ALL OTHER EXAMPLES. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL ONE-VS-ONE (OVO) CLASSIFICATION SCHEME FOR DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS THAT TRAINS EACH OUTPUT UNIT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN A SPECIFIC PAIR OF CLASSES. THIS METHOD INCREASES THE NUMBER OF OUTPUT UNITS COMPARED TO THE ONE-VS-ALL CLASSIFICATION SCHEME BUT MAKES LEARNING CORRECT DECISION BOUNDARIES MUCH EASIER. IN ADDITION TO CHANGING THE NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE, WE CHANGED THE LOSS FUNCTION, CREATED A CODE MATRIX TO TRANSFORM THE ONE-HOT ENCODING TO A NEW LABEL ENCODING, AND CHANGED THE METHOD FOR CLASSIFYING EXAMPLES. TO ANALYZE THE ADVANTAGES OF THE PROPOSED METHOD, WE COMPARED THE ONE-VS-ONE AND ONE-VS-ALL CLASSIFICATION METHODS ON THREE PLANT RECOGNITION DATASETS (INCLUDING A NOVEL DATASET THAT WE CREATED) AND A DATASET WITH IMAGES OF DIFFERENT MONKEY SPECIES USING TWO DEEP ARCHITECTURES. THE TWO DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) ARCHITECTURES, INCEPTION-V3 AND RESNET-50, ARE TRAINED FROM SCRATCH OR PRE-TRAINED WEIGHTS.

YANG C;PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION BY INTEGRATING SHAPE AND TEXTURE FEATURES;PLANT LEAF IDENTIFICATION IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE IN THE FIELDS OF COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A NEW APPROACH TO PLANT LEAF IDENTIFICATION, ONE THAT INTEGRATES SHAPE AND TEXTURE CHARACTERISTICS. FIRST, WE INTRODUCE THE SHAPE AND TEXTURE FEATURES USED BY THE PROPOSED PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION METHOD. THE PROPOSED MULTISCALE TRIANGLE DESCRIPTOR (MTD) IS EMPLOYED TO CHARACTERIZE THE SHAPE INFORMATION OF A PLANT LEAF, AND THE LOCAL BINARY PATTERN HISTOGRAM FOURIER (LBP-HF) IS USED AS THE TEXTURE FEATURE. THEN, THE SHAPE AND TEXTURE FEATURES OF A LEAF IMAGE ARE COMBINED BY WEIGHTED DISTANCE MEASUREMENT, WHERE L1 DISTANCE AND CHI-SQUARE DISTANCE ARE USED FOR SHAPE AND TEXTURE FEATURES, RESPECTIVELY. THE PROPOSED APPROACH PROVIDES A ROBUST DESCRIPTOR FOR THE TASK OF PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION BY COMBINING THE COMPLEMENTARY MTD AND LBP-HF FEATURES. THE PROPOSED APPROACH HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY EVALUATED ON THREE BENCHMARK LEAF DATASETS, INCLUDING THE FLAVIA, SWEDISH AND MEW2012 LEAF DATASETS. OUR METHOD ACHIEVES 77.6%, 85.7%, AND 67.5% RETRIEVAL ACCURACY ON THE FLAVIA, SWEDISH AND MEW2012 LEAF DATASETS, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE THE CORRESPONDING CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY IS 99.1%, 98.4%, 95.6%.

THE CHARACTERIZING MACRO PATTERN IS ENCODED BY AN IN-DEPTH GRADIENT THAT DESCRIBES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SCALE LEVELS AND THEIR ADAPTIVE STATISTICAL PROTOTYPE. BESIDES THIS HANDCRAFTED FEATURE DESCRIPTOR, A LEARNING-BASED DESCRIPTION IS PERFORMED WITH THE RESNET34 MODEL FOR BARK CLASSIFICATION.

IN LARGE-SCALE EXPERIMENTS, HOWEVER, UAV IMAGES SUFFER FROM CONTAINING A MULTITUDINOUS AMOUNT OF CROPS IN A COMPLEX CANOPY ARCHITECTURE. ESPECIALLY FOR THE OBSERVATION OF TEMPORAL EFFECTS, THIS COMPLICATES THE RECOGNITION OF INDIVIDUAL PLANTS OVER SEVERAL IMAGES AND THE EXTRACTION OF RELEVANT INFORMATION TREMENDOUSLY. RESULTS: IN THIS WORK, WE PRESENT A HANDS-ON WORKFLOW FOR THE AUTOMATIZED TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL IDENTIFICATION AND INDIVIDUALIZATION OF CROP IMAGES FROM UAVS ABBREVIATED AS \CATALOGING\""BASED ON COMPREHENSIBLE COMPUTER VISION METHODS. WE EVALUATE THE WORKFLOW ON 2 REAL-WORLD DATASETS. ONE DATASET IS RECORDED FOR OBSERVATION OF CERCOSPORA LEAF SPOT - A FUNGAL DISEASE - IN SUGAR BEET OVER AN ENTIRE GROWING CYCLE. THE OTHER ONE DEALS WITH HARVEST PREDICTION OF CAULIFLOWER PLANTS. THE PLANT CATALOG IS UTILIZED FOR THE EXTRACTION OF SINGLE PLANT IMAGES SEEN OVER MULTIPLE TIME POINTS. THIS GATHERS A LARGE-SCALE SPATIOTEMPORAL IMAGE DATASET THAT IN TURN CAN BE APPLIED TO TRAIN FURTHER MACHINE LEARNING MODELS INCLUDING VARIOUS DATA LAYERS. CONCLUSION: THE PRESENTED APPROACH IMPROVES ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF UAV DATA IN AGRICULTURE SIGNIFICANTLY. BY VALIDATION WITH SOME REFERENCE DATA, OUR METHOD SHOWS AN ACCURACY THAT IS SIMILAR TO MORE COMPLEX DEEP LEARNING-BASED RECOGNITION TECHNIQUES. OUR WORKFLOW IS ABLE TO AUTOMATIZE PLANT CATALOGING AND TRAINING IMAGE EXTRACTION, ESPECIALLY FOR LARGE DATASETS. Â© 2022 THE AUTHOR(S) 2022.

"CAO J;WANG B;BROWN D";SIMILARITY BASED LEAF IMAGE RETRIEVAL USING MULTISCALE RANGLE DESCRIPTION;LEAF IMAGE IDENTIFICATION IS A SIGNIFICANT AND CHALLENGING APPLICATION OF COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE PROCESSING. A CENTRAL ISSUE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS TASK IS HOW TO EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY DESCRIBE THE LEAF IMAGES AND MEASURE THEIR SIMILARITIES. IN THIS PAPER, A NOVEL SHAPE DESCRIPTOR TERMED R-ANGLE IS PROPOSED. R-ANGLE DESCRIBES THE CURVATURE OF THE CONTOUR BY MEASURING THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE INTERSECTIONS OF THE SHAPE CONTOUR WITH A CIRCLE OF RADIUS R CENTERED AT POINTS SAMPLED AROUND THE CONTOUR. IT IS INTRINSICALLY INVARIANT TO GROUP TRANSFORMS INCLUDING SCALING, ROTATION AND TRANSLATION. VARYING THE PARAMETER R OF THE PROPOSED R-ANGLE NATURALLY INTRODUCES THE NOTATION OF SCALE, WHICH WE LEVERAGE TO PROVIDE A COARSE-TO-FINE DESCRIPTION OF THE LOCAL CURVATURE. A LOCAL SCALE ARRANGEMENT IS PROPOSED BY TAKING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN EACH CONTOUR POINT AND THE CENTER OF THE SHAPE TO BE THE MAXIMUM SCALE FOR A GIVEN CONTOUR POINT. TWO MATCHING SCHEMES, INCLUDING L1-NORM MATCHING AND DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING BASED MATCHING, ARE APPLIED TO MEASURE THE SIMILARITIES OF THE LEAF SHAPES. THE RETRIEVAL EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED ON TWO CHALLENGING LEAF IMAGE DATASETS INDICATE THAT THE PROPOSED METHOD SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORMS THE STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS FOR LEAF IDENTIFICATION. AN ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENT ON AN ANIMAL DATASET ALSO INDICATES ITS POTENTIAL FOR GENERAL SHAPE RECOGNITION.

THE INCREASING ACCURACY OF MACHINE LEARNING IS WELL ESTABLISHED, BUT IT IS CURRENTLY UNCLEAR IF, AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES, FREE-TO-USE MOBILE PHONE APPLICATIONS ARE ACCURATE FOR IDENTIFYING PLANTS TO SPECIES LEVEL IN REAL-WORLD FIELD CONDITIONS. WE TEST FIVE POPULAR AND FREE IDENTIFICATION APPLICATIONS FOR PLANTS USING 857 PROFESSIONALLY IDENTIFIED IMAGES OF 277 SPECIES FROM 204 GENERA. ACROSS ALL APPLICATIONS, 85% OF IMAGES WERE IDENTIFIED CORRECTLY IN THE TOP FIVE SUGGESTIONS, AND 69% WERE CORRECT WITH THE FIRST SUGGESTION. PLANT TYPE (WOODY, FORBS, GRASSES, RUSHES/SEDGES, FERNS/HORSETAILS) WAS A SIGNIFICANT DETERMINANT OF IDENTIFICATION PERFORMANCE FOR EACH APPLICATION. FOR SOME APPLICATIONS, IMAGE SALIENCY WAS ALSO IMPORTANT; EXPOSURE AND FOCUS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT. APPLICATIONS PERFORMED WELL, WITH AT LEAST ONE OF THE THREE BEST-PERFORMING APPLICATIONS IDENTIFYING 96% OF IMAGES CORRECTLY AS THEIR FIRST SUGGESTION. WE CONCLUDE THAT, SUBJECT TO SOME CAVEATS, FREE PHONE-BASED PLANT IDENTIFICATION APPLICATIONS ARE VALID AND USEFUL TOOLS FOR THOSE WANTING RAPID IDENTIFICATION AND FOR ANYONE WANTING TO ENGAGE WITH THE NATURAL WORLD.

"NI L;ZHANG L;XIE J;LUO J";PATTERN RECOGNITION OF CHINESE FLUECURED TOBACCOS BY AN IMPROVED AND SIMPLIFIED KNEAREST NEIGHBORS CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM ON NEAR INFRARED SPECTRA;IN TOBACCO INDUSTRY OF CHINA, TOBACCO LEAVES ARE CLASSIFIED AND MANAGED IN TERMS OF THEIR CULTIVATION AREAS AND PLANT PARTS OF TOBACCO-STALKS. HOWEVER, SOMETIMES INTENTIONALLY OR INVOLUNTARY MISLABELING CULTIVATION AREAS, BLENDING TOBACCO PLANT PARTS WOULD OCCUR INTO TOBACCO MARKET. THE ERROR WILL AFFECT THE STYLE AND QUALITY OF CIGARETTES. IN THE PRESENT WORK, MORE THAN 1000 CHINESE FLUE-CURED TOBACCO LEAF SAMPLES, WHICH HAVE 12 GENOTYPES AND CULTIVATED FROM 5 TO 10 REGIONS OF CHINA IN 2003 AND 2004, HAVE BEEN DISCRIMINATED BY MEANS OF AN IMPROVED AND SIMPLIFIED KNN CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM (IS-KNN) BASED ON NEAR INFRARED (NIR) SPECTRA. AN ORIGINAL METHOD OF OPTIMIZING NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS (PCS) BASED ON ANALYSIS OF ERROR AND CROSS-VALIDATION WAS ADVANCED. COMPARED WITH CONVENTIONAL PATTERN RECOGNITION METHODS KNN, NN, LDA AND PLS-DA, IS-KNN EXHIBITS GOOD ADAPTABILITY IN DISCRIMINATION OF COMPLICATED CHINESE FLUE-CURED TOBACCOS. THE PRACTICE IN THIS WORK SHOWS THAT OPTIMIZED NUMBER OF PCS AND PERFORMANCE OF CLASSIFICATION MODELS ARE CLOSELY RELATIVE TO COMPLICATED EXTENT OF SAMPLES BUT NOT TO NUMBER OF CATEGORIES OR SAMPLES. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THE USEFULNESS OF NIR SPECTRA COMBINED WITH CHEMOMETRICS AS AN OBJECTIVE AND RAPID METHOD FOR THE AUTHENTICATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF TOBACCO LEAVES OR OTHER KINDS OF POWDER SAMPLES.

IT IS RICH IN SUBSTANCES, SUCH AS TEA POLYPHENOLS AND POLYSACCHARIDES, THAT ARE CLOSELY RELATED TO HUMAN HEALTH. HOWEVER, FRESH TEA LEAVES PICKED BY MACHINES ARE NEITHER NEAT NOR UNIFORM. IN THIS STUDY, WE APPLY A DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHM AND THE DELTA PARALLEL ROBOTIC ARM FOR HIGH-PRECISION AND FAST SORTING OF MACHINE-PICKED FRESH TEA LEAVES. FIRST, A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK ALGORITHM AND A REGIONAL SEGMENTATION METHOD ARE USED TO ACHIEVE FAST IDENTIFICATION AND LOCALIZATION OF MACHINE-PICKED FRESH TEA LEAVES. SECOND, THE ACTUAL RUNNING TIME MODEL OF THE STEPPER MOTOR AT DIFFERENT PULSE FREQUENCIES WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE INTERPOLATION FITTING METHOD. THE RUNNING TIMES OF THE PARALLEL MECHANICAL ARM ASSOCIATED WITH S-CURVE TYPE ACCELERATION AND DECELERATION MOTIONS WERE CALCULATED ACCURATELY USING THIS MODEL, AND THE SORTING POINT OF TEA FRESH LEAVES WAS THEN DETERMINED. A MULTI-OBJECTIVE, CONTINUOUS SORTING MODEL OF MACHINE-PICKED FRESH TEA LEAVES IS CONSTRUCTED TO VERIFY AND OPTIMIZE THE MODEL EFFECTS. THE RESULTS OF THE ROBOT'S ARM RUNNING-TIME TEST SHOW THAT THE RUNNING TIME FROM THE END OF THE ROBOTIC ARM'S APPLICATION TO THE FRESH TEA LEAF SORTING PLANE IS IN THE RANGE 500â€“1800 MS. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS OF FRESH TEA LEAF RECOGNITION AND CLASSIFICATION SHOW THAT AFTER 150 ITERATIONS, THE RECOGNITION ACCURACY OF THE VALIDATION SET CAN REACH 99.82%. FINALLY, THE AVERAGE SORTING ACCURACY OF THE FOUR EXPERIMENTS REACH 89%, WITH THE HIGHEST SORTING ACCURACY REACHING UP TO 92%. THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE PROPOSED METHOD LEADS TO AN EXCELLENT SORTING EFFECT PERTAINING TO MACHINE-PICKED FRESH TEA LEAVES.

THIS IS ENABLED BY COMBINING THE USE OF CHEAP HIGH-QUALITY CAMERAS WITH RECENT ADVANCES IN DEEP LEARNING COMPUTE SOLUTIONS TO DERIVE RELEVANT THEMATIC INFORMATION. WE PRESENT A FRAMEWORK TO COLLECT AND EXTRACT CROP TYPE AND PHENOLOGICAL INFORMATION FROM STREET LEVEL IMAGERY USING COMPUTER VISION. MONITORING CROP PHENOLOGY IS CRITICAL TO ASSESS GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY AND CROP YIELD. DURING THE 2018 GROWING SEASON, HIGH-DEFINITION PICTURES WERE CAPTURED WITH SIDE-LOOKING ACTION CAMERAS IN THE FLEVOLAND PROVINCE OF THE NETHERLANDS. EACH MONTH FROM MARCH TO OCTOBER, A FIXED 200-KM ROUTE WAS SURVEYED COLLECTING ONE PICTURE PER SECOND RESULTING IN A TOTAL OF 400,000 GEO-TAGGED PICTURES. AT 220 SPECIFIC PARCEL LOCATIONS, DETAILED ON THE SPOT CROP PHENOLOGY OBSERVATIONS WERE RECORDED FOR 17 CROP TYPES (INCLUDING BARE SOIL, GREEN MANURE, AND TULIPS): BARE SOIL, CARROTS, GREEN MANURE, GRASSLAND, GRASS SEEDS, MAIZE, ONION, POTATO, SUMMER BARLEY, SUGAR BEET, SPRING CEREALS, SPRING WHEAT, TULIPS, VEGETABLES, WINTER BARLEY, WINTER CEREALS AND WINTER WHEAT. FURTHERMORE, THE TIME SPAN INCLUDED SPECIFIC PRE-EMERGENCE PARCEL STAGES, SUCH AS DIFFERENTLY CULTIVATED BARE SOIL FOR SPRING AND SUMMER CROPS AS WELL AS POST-HARVEST CULTIVATION PRACTICES, E.G. GREEN MANURING AND CATCH CROPS. CLASSIFICATION WAS DONE USING TENSORFLOW WITH A WELL-KNOWN IMAGE RECOGNITION MODEL, BASED ON TRANSFER LEARNING WITH CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (MOBILENET). A HYPERTUNING METHODOLOGY WAS DEVELOPED TO OBTAIN THE BEST PERFORMING MODEL AMONG 160 MODELS. THIS BEST MODEL WAS APPLIED ON AN INDEPENDENT INFERENCE SET DISCRIMINATING CROP TYPE WITH A MACRO F1 SCORE OF 88.1% AND MAIN PHENOLOGICAL STAGE AT 86.9% AT THE PARCEL LEVEL.

AIMING AT THE LOW ACCURACY OF EXISTING CROP DISEASE RECOGNITION METHODS, WE IMPROVE THE ATTENTION MECHANISM AND RESIDUAL NEURAL NETWORK (RESNET) TO PROPOSE A DUAL-BRANCH, EFFICIENT, CHANNEL ATTENTION (DECA)-BASED CROP DISEASE RECOGNITION MODEL. THE DECA MODULE USES A DUAL-BRANCH 1D CONVOLUTION OPERATION TO FILTER EFFECTIVE FEATURE INFORMATION. IT ALSO INTRODUCES AN ADAPTIVE CONVOLUTION KERNEL PARAMETER KAND AN ADAPTIVE PARAMETER Î‘TO PARTICIPATE IN THE REVERSE TRAINING OF THE MODEL SO THAT THE MODEL CAN INDEPENDENTLY SELECT EFFECTIVE FEATURES AND ESTABLISH DEPENDENCIES BETWEEN CHANNELS. THEN, THE DECA MODULE IS ADDED TO THE RESIDUAL MODULE TO RECALIBRATE THE CHANNEL CHARACTERISTICS AND IMPROVE THE CHARACTERISTIC REPRESENTABILITY OF THE RESIDUAL MODULE. FINALLY, A DECA_RESNET MODEL IS PROPOSED TO REALIZE CROP DISEASE RECOGNITION. THE CROP DISEASE MODEL BASED ON IMPROVED ATTENTION IS VERIFIED ON THE AI CHALLENGER 2018 DATASET, PLANTVILLAGE DATASET, AND SELF-COLLECTED CUCUMBER DISEASE DATASET; THE DISEASE RECOGNITION ACCURACIES ARE 86.35%, 99.74% AND 98.54%, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ARE HIGHER THAN THOSE OF THE RESNET AND SQUEEZE-AND-EXCITATION NETWORK (SENET) BEFORE IMPROVEMENT. THE RECOGNITION ACCURACY OF THE PROPOSED MODEL IN THE PLANTVILLAGE DATASET IS HIGHER THAN THAT OF EXISTING MODELS. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED PLANT RECOGNITION MODEL WITH 18 LAYERS (DECA_RESNET18) CAN ACHIEVE A HIGH RECOGNITION ACCURACY.

AN INTELLIGENT SPRAYING SYSTEM CAN APPLY AGROCHEMICALS ON AN AS-NEEDED BASIS BY DETECTING AND SELECTIVELY TARGETING THE WEEDS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (DCNNS) FOR DETECTING LAMB'S QUARTERS (CHENOPODIUM ALBUM) IN POTATO FIELDS. FIVE POTATO FIELDS WERE SELECTED IN PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND (PEI) AND NEW BRUNSWICK (NB), CANADA TO COLLECT IMAGES OF SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY VARIED POTATO PLANTS AND LAMB'S QUARTERS. THE IMAGE DATABASE INCLUDED PICTURES, TAKEN UNDER VARYING GROWTH STAGES OF POTATO, OUTDOOR LIGHT (CLEAR, CLOUDY, AND PARTLY CLOUDY), AND SHADOWY CONDITIONS. THE IMAGES WERE TRAINED FOR DCNN MODELS, NAMELY GOOGLENET, VGG-16, AND EFFICIENTNET TO CLASSIFY LAMB'S QUARTERS AND POTATO PLANTS. PERFORMANCE OF TWO FRAMEWORKS, NAMELY TENSORFLOW AND PYTORCH, WERE COMPARED IN TRAINING, TESTING, AND DURING INFERRING THE DCNNS. RESULTS SHOWED EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE OF DCNNS IN LAMB'S QUARTERS AND POTATO PLANT CLASSIFICATION (ACCURACY > 90%). HOWEVER, THE EFFICIENTNET WITH PYTORCH FRAMEWORK SHOWED A MAXIMUM ACCURACY OF (0.92â€“0.97) FOR EVERY GROWTH STAGE OF THE PLANTS. INFERENCE TIMES OF DCNNS WERE RECORDED USING THREE GRAPHICS PROCESSING UNITS (GPUS), NAMELY NVIDIA GEFORCE 930MX, NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX1080 TI, AND NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX1050. ALL THE DCNNS PERFORMED BETTER WITH PYTORCH THAN TENSORFLOW FRAMEWORKS. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE TRAINED MODELS CAN BE USED IN AUTOMATION OF THE SPRAYING SYSTEMS FOR THE SITE-SPECIFIC APPLICATION OF AGROCHEMICALS FOR WEED CONTROL IN POTATO FIELDS.

UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES (UAVS) CARRYING RGB CAMERAS ARE NOVEL TOOLS FOR AUTOMATIC FIELD MAPPING, AND THE ANALYSIS OF UAV IMAGES BY DEEP LEARNING METHODS CAN PROVIDE RELEVANT AGRONOMIC INFORMATION. UAV-BASED CAMERA SYSTEMS AND A DEEP LEARNING IMAGE ANALYSIS PIPELINE ARE IMPLEMENTED FOR A FULLY AUTOMATED PLANT COUNTING IN SUGAR BEET, MAIZE, AND STRAWBERRY FIELDS IN THE PRESENT STUDY. FIVE LOCATIONS WERE MONITORED AT DIFFERENT GROWTH STAGES, AND THE CROP NUMBER PER PLOT WAS AUTOMATICALLY PREDICTED BY USING A FULLY CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORK (FCN) PIPELINE. OUR FCN-BASED APPROACH IS A SINGLE MODEL FOR JOINTLY DETERMINING BOTH THE EXACT STEM LOCATION OF CROP AND WEED PLANTS AND A PIXEL-WISE PLANT CLASSIFICATION CONSIDERING CROP, WEED, AND SOIL. TO DETERMINATE THE APPROACH PERFORMANCE, PREDICTED CROP COUNTING WAS COMPARED TO VISUALLY ASSESSED GROUND TRUTH DATA. RESULTS SHOW THAT UAV-BASED COUNTING OF SUGAR-BEET PLANTS DELIVERS FORECAST ERRORS LOWER THAN 4.6%, AND THE MAIN FACTORS FOR PERFORMANCE ARE RELATED TO THE INTRA-ROW DISTANCE AND THE GROWTH STAGE. THE PIPELINE'S EXTENSION TO OTHER CROPS IS POSSIBLE; THE ERRORS OF THE PREDICTIONS ARE LOWER THAN 4% UNDER PRACTICAL FIELD CONDITIONS FOR MAIZE AND STRAWBERRY FIELDS.

SEVERAL RECENT STUDIES HAVE PROPOSED TO IMPROVE EXISTING PROCEDURES FOR EARLY DETECTION OF PLANT DISEASES THROUGH MODERN AUTOMATIC IMAGE RECOGNITION SYSTEMS BASED ON DEEP LEARNING. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE STUDY THESE METHODS IN DETAIL, ESPECIALLY THOSE BASED ON CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS. WE FIRST EXAMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE RELEVANT TO FINE-TUNE A PRE-TRAINED MODEL ON A PLANT IDENTIFICATION TASK RATHER THAN A GENERAL OBJECT RECOGNITION TASK. IN PARTICULAR, WE SHOW, THROUGH VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES, THAT THE CHARACTERISTICS LEARNED DIFFER ACCORDING TO THE APPROACH ADOPTED AND THAT THEY DO NOT NECESSARILY FOCUS ON THE PART AFFECTED BY THE DISEASE. THEREFORE, WE INTRODUCE A MORE INTUITIVE METHOD THAT CONSIDERS DISEASES INDEPENDENTLY OF CROPS, AND WE SHOW THAT IT IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE CLASSIC CROP-DISEASE PAIR APPROACH, ESPECIALLY WHEN DEALING WITH DISEASE INVOLVING CROPS THAT ARE NOT ILLUSTRATED IN THE TRAINING DATABASE.

TO AVOID YIELD LOSS, WEEDS MUST BE REMOVED EARLY IN THE CROP CYCLE. SHORTAGES OF FARM LABORERS FOR HAND WEEDING AND LACK OF EFFECTIVE VEGETABLE HERBICIDES IS STIMULATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLIGENT WEEDERS. ONE CHALLENGE FOR DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE INTELLIGENT WEEDERS IS THE PRECISION DIFFERENTIATION OF VEGETABLE CROPS AND WEEDS. CROP SIGNALING IS A TECHNIQUE THAT ENABLES RAPID AND ACCURATE IDENTIFICATION OF TARGET CROPS. IN THIS STUDY, AN APPROPRIATE DOSE OF FLUORESCENT COMPOUNDS ALLOWED THE VEGETABLE CROP LOCATIONS IN THE FIELD TO BE RELIABLY DETECTABLE BY SMART MACHINES. THE STUDY EXAMINED PROTOCOLS FOR CROP ROOT TREATMENT, COMPUTER VISION SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT, CROP SIGNAL DETECTION AND BIOMASS EVALUATION. RHODAMINE B (RH-B) IS A FLUORESCENT COMPOUND WITH UNIQUE OPTICAL PROPERTIES. DIFFERENT DOSES OF RH-B WERE APPLIED TO THE CELERY ROOTS FOR VARIOUS DURATIONS PRIOR TO TRANSPLANTATION TO ASSESS RH-B TRANSPORT IN THE PLANT, ITS PHOTOSTABILITY AND POTENTIAL IMPACT ON SEEDLING GROWTH IN THE NATURAL OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENT OF A FARM.

COMPARED WITH 60 PPM SOLUTION OF RH-B, HIGHER DOSES OF RH-B INCLUDING 90, 180, AND 270 PPM RESULTED IN GREATER ABSORPTION BY THE PLANT, BUT SUCH THREE CONCENTRATIONS INJURED THE PLANT. THE BIOMASS TEST RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE TREATMENT OF CELERY ROOTS FOR TWO DAYS WITH A 60 PPM SOLUTION OF RH-B WAS SAFE FOR CELERY PLANTS. THIS RH-B DOSAGE HAD GOOD PHOTOSTABILITY IN CELERY SEEDLINGS FOR ABOUT 5 WEEKS AFTER TRANSPLANTING. AN EFFECTIVE DOSE OF SYSTEMIC RH-B ALLOWED FOR THE RAPID IDENTIFICATION OF CELERY PLANTS AT EARLY GROWTH STAGES, THEREBY FACILITATING THE AUTOMATIC DIFFERENTIATION OF WEEDS AND CROPS BY A ROBOTIC MACHINE VISION SYSTEM.

DESPITE THE AVAILABILITY OF MANY INTELLIGENT PROGRAMS DESIGNED FOR PLANT CLASSIFICATION, IDENTIFYING THE GROWTH STAGE OF A VEGETABLE FROM ITS LEAF FEATURES REMAINS A MAJOR CHALLENGE. GYNURA BICOLOR DC (G. BICOLOR) IS AN IMPORTANT VEGETABLE, AND ITS LEAVES ARE HARVESTED FOR CULINARY USE AT A SPECIFIC GROWTH STAGE. THE PRODUCE QUALITY OF LEAVES IS COMPROMISED WHEN THEY ARE HARVESTED AT IMPROPER STAGE. A CLASSIFICATION MODEL NAMED GL-CNN WAS PROPOSED BASED ON CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. THE PROPOSED MODEL MERGES THE FEATURES USING A NETWORK FUSION STRATEGY TO EXPAND THE FEATURE REPRESENTATION ON THE BASIS OF THE INTACT LEAF AND LEAF PATCH IMAGE SETS. THE NETWORKS WERE VALIDATED USING A NEW DATASET OF G. BICOLOR PLANTED AND COLLECTED BY OURSELVES. â€œEARLY FUSIONâ€ AND â€œLATE FUSIONâ€ NETWORKS WERE DESIGNED AND COMPARED WITH GL-CNN TO VERIFY THE RATIONALITY OF NETWORK FUSION LOCATION.

WEED IDENTIFICATION AT EARLY GROWTH STAGE CONTRIBUTES TO REDUCED HERBICIDE RATES. HOWEVER, WHILE COMPUTER VISION ALONGSIDE DEEP LEARNING HAVE OVERCOME THE PERFORMANCE OF APPROACHES THAT USE HAND-CRAFTED FEATURES, THERE ARE STILL SOME OPEN CHALLENGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A RELIABLE AUTOMATIC PLANT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM. THESE TYPE OF SYSTEMS HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT DIFFERENT SOURCES OF VARIABILITY, SUCH AS GROWTH STAGES AND SOIL CONDITIONS, WITH THE ADDED CONSTRAINT OF THE LIMITED SIZE OF USUAL DATASETS. THIS STUDY PROPOSES A NOVEL CROP/WEED IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM THAT RELIES ON A COMBINATION OF FINE-TUNING PRE-TRAINED CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS (XCEPTION, INCEPTION-RESNET, VGNETS, MOBILENET AND DENSENET) WITH THE â€œTRADITIONALâ€ MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFIERS (SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES, XGBOOST AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION) TRAINED WITH THE PREVIOUSLY DEEP EXTRACTED FEATURES. THE AIM OF THIS APPROACH WAS TO AVOID OVERFITTING AND TO OBTAIN A ROBUST AND CONSISTENT PERFORMANCE. TO EVALUATE THIS APPROACH, AN OPEN ACCESS DATASET OF TWO CROP [TOMATO (SOLANUM LYCOPERSICUM L.) AND COTTON (GOSSYPIUM HIRSUTUM L.)] AND TWO WEED SPECIES [BLACK NIGHTSHADE (SOLANUM NIGRUM L.) AND VELVETLEAF (ABUTILON THEOPHRASTI MEDIK.)] WAS GENERATED. THE PICTURES WERE TAKEN BY DIFFERENT PRODUCTION SITES ACROSS GREECE UNDER NATURAL VARIABLE LIGHT CONDITIONS FROM RGB CAMERAS. THE RESULTS REVEALED THAT A COMBINATION OF FINE-TUNED DENSENET AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE ACHIEVED A MICRO F1 SCORE OF 99.29% WITH A VERY LOW PERFORMANCE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TRAIN AND TEST SETS. OTHER EVALUATED APPROACHES ALSO OBTAINED REPEATEDLY MORE THAN 95% F1 SCORE.

A RELIABLE AND PRACTICAL PLANT IDENTIFICATION TECHNIQUE WOULD ENABLE THE REDUCTION OF HERBICIDE AMOUNTS AND LOWERING OF PRODUCTION COSTS, ALONG WITH REDUCING THE DAMAGE TO THE ECOSYSTEM. WHEN THE SEEDS HAVE BEEN SOWN ROW-WISE, MOST WEEDS MAY BE LOCATED BETWEEN THE SOWING ROWS. THE PRESENT WORK DESCRIBES A CLUSTERING-BASED METHOD FOR RECOGNITION OF PLANTLET ROWS FROM A SET OF AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS, TAKEN BY A DRONE FLYING AT APPROXIMATELY TEN METERS. THE ALGORITHM INCLUDES THREE PHASES: SEGMENTATION OF GREEN OBJECTS IN THE VIEW, FEATURE EXTRACTION, AND CLUSTERING OF PLANTS INTO INDIVIDUAL ROWS. SEGMENTATION SEPARATES THE PLANTS FROM THE BACKGROUND. THE MAIN FEATURE TO BE EXTRACTED IS THE CENTER OF GRAVITY OF EACH PLANT SEGMENT. A TENTATIVE CLUSTERING IS OBTAINED PIECEWISE BY APPLYING THE 2D FOURIER TRANSFORM TO IMAGE BLOCKS TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT THE DIRECTION AND THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE ROWS. THE PRECISE SOWING LINE POSITION IS FINALLY DERIVED BY PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS.

HERE, WE APPLIED DECISION-TREE INDUCTION TO A SUBSET OF DATA FROM THE TRY PLANT TRAIT DATABASE TO (1) ASSESS THE POTENTIAL OF DECISION TREES FOR PLANT IDENTIFICATION AND (2) DETERMINE INFORMATIVE TRAITS FOR DISTINGUISHING TAXA. METHODS: DECISION TREES WERE INDUCED USING 16 VEGETATIVE AND FLORAL TRAITS (689 SPECIES, 20 GENERA). WE ASSESSED HOW WELL THE ALGORITHM CLASSIFIED SPECIES FROM TEST DATA AND PINPOINTED THOSE TRAITS THAT WERE IMPORTANT FOR IDENTIFICATION ACROSS DIVERSE TAXA. RESULTS: THE UNPRUNED TREE CORRECTLY PLACED 98% OF THE SPECIES IN OUR DATA SET INTO GENERA, INDICATING ITS PROMISE FOR DISTINGUISHING AMONG THE SPECIES USED TO CONSTRUCT THEM. FURTHERMORE, IN THE PRUNED TREE, AN AVERAGE OF 89% OF THE SPECIES FROM THE TEST DATA SETS WERE PROPERLY CLASSIFIED INTO THEIR GENERA, DEMONSTRATING THE FLEXIBILITY OF DECISION TREES TO ALSO CLASSIFY NEW SPECIES INTO GENERA WITHIN THE TREE.

"AL-QURRAN R;AL-AYYOUB M;SHATNAWI A";PLANT CLASSIFICATION IN THE WILD ENERGY EVALUATION FOR DEEP LEARNING MODELS;HAVING A SYSTEM THAT CAN TAKE AN IMAGE OF A NATURAL SCENE AND ACCURATELY CLASSIFY THE PLANTS IN IT IS OF UNDENIABLE IMPORTANCE. HOWEVER, THE COMPLEXITIES OF DEALING WITH NATURAL SCENE IMAGES AND THE VAST DIVERSITY OF PLANTS IN THE WILD MAKE DESIGNING SUCH A CLASSIFIER A CHALLENGING TASK. DEEP LEARNING (DL) LENDS ITSELF AS VIABLE SOLUTION TO TACKLE SUCH COMPLEX PROBLEM. HOWEVER, ADVANCED IN DL ARCHITECTURES AND SOFTWARE (INCLUDING DL FRAMEWORKS) COME WITH A HIGH COST IN TERMS OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION ESPECIALLY WHEN EMPLOYING GRAPHICS PROCESSING UNITS (GPU). AS DATA EXPANDS RAPIDLY, THE NEED TO CREATE ENERGY-AWARE MODELS INCREASES IN ORDER TO REDUCE ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND MOVE TOWARDS â€œGREENER AIâ€. SINCE THE PROBLEM OF DESIGNING ENERGY-AWARE ARCHITECTURES FOR PLANT CLASSIFICATION HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE LITERATURE, OUR WORK COMES TO START BRIDGING THIS GAP BY FOCUSING NOT ONLY ON THE MODELSâ€™ PERFORMANCE, BUT ALSO ON THEIR ENERGY USAGE ON BOTH CPU AND GPU PLATFORMS. WE CONSIDER DIFFERENT STATE-OF-THE-ART CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNN) ARCHITECTURES AND TRAIN THEM ON TWO FAMOUS CHALLENGING PLANTS DATASETS: INATURALIST AND HERBARIUM. OUR EXPERIMENTS ARE MEANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN ACCURACY AND ENERGY CONSUMPTION. FOR EXAMPLES, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT WHILE GPU-BOUND MODELS CAN BE ABOUT 40% FASTER IN TERMS OF TRAINING TIME THAN SIMPLE MODELS RUNNING ON CPU, THE LATTERâ€™S ENERGY CONSUMPTION IS ONLY TWO THIRDS OF THE FORMER.

"AL-QURRAN R;AL-AYYOUB M;SHATNAWI A";PLANT CLASSIFICATION IN THE WILD A TRANSFER LEARNING APPROACH;DATASETS SPECIALIZED IN WILDLIFE USUALLY CONTAIN IMBALANCED CLASSES OF NATURAL WILD IMAGES SUCH AS, FOR INSTANCE, PLANT IMAGES, WHICH ARE ACQUIRED FROM THE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT WITH NATURAL SCENE BACKGROUND. DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS HAVE PROVEN THEIR EFFICIENCY IN CLASSIFYING SUCH DATASETS. HOWEVER, SUCH AN APPROACH REQUIRES A WORKAROUND TO APPROXIMATELY BALANCE THE CLASSES IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE OCCURRENCE OF OVERFITTING DURING THE TRAINING PHASE OF THE NEURAL NETWORK. MANY APPROACHES EXIST TO OVERCOME THIS PROBLEM INCLUDES OVER-SAMPLING, UNDERSAMPLING, GENERATING SYNTHETIC SAMPLES, DATA AUGMENTATION, ETC. THE INATURALIST SPECIES CLASSIFICATION AND DETECTION DATASET REPRESENTS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF VASTLY IMBALANCED DATASETS. IT CONTAINS 13 SUPERCLASSES. THIS WORK FOCUSES ON THE PLANTAE SUPERCLASS AND BUILDS A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK TO DISTINGUISH A SUBSET OF THE SUBCLASSES OF PLANTAE.

"ZHANG Y;SLAUGHTER D";HYPERSPECTRAL SPECIES MAPPING FOR AUTOMATIC WEED CONTROL IN TOMATO UNDER THERMAL ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS;THIS WORK STUDIED THE IMPACTS OF VARIATIONS IN ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURE ON HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGING FEATURES IN THE VISIBLE AND NEAR INFRARED REGIONS FOR ROBUST SPECIES IDENTIFICATION FOR WEED MAPPING IN TOMATO PRODUCTION. SIX MAJOR CALIFORNIAN PROCESSING TOMATO CULTIVARS, BLACK NIGHTSHADE (SOLANUM NIGRUM L.) AND REDROOT PIGWEED (AMARANTHUS RETROFLEXUS L.) WERE GROWN UNDER A VARIETY OF DIURNAL TEMPERATURE RANGES SIMULATING CONDITIONS COMMON IN THE CALIFORNIAN SPRINGTIME PLANTING PERIOD AND ONE ADDITIONAL TREATMENT SIMULATING GREENHOUSE GROWING CONDITIONS. THE PRINCIPAL CHANGE IN CANOPY REFLECTANCE WITH VARYING TEMPERATURE OCCURRED IN THE 480-670 AND 720-810. NM REGIONS. THE OVERALL CLASSIFICATION RATE RANGED FROM 62.5% TO 91.6% WHEN CLASSIFIERS TRAINED UNDER SINGLE TEMPERATURES WERE APPLIED TO PLANTS GROWN AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES. ELIMINATING THE 480-670. NM REGION FROM THE CLASSIFIER'S FEATURE SET MITIGATED THE TEMPERATURE EFFECT BY STABILIZING THE TOTAL CROP VS. WEED CLASSIFICATION RATE AT 86.4% OVER THE TEMPERATURE RANGES. A SITE-SPECIFIC RECALIBRATION METHOD WAS ALSO SUCCESSFUL IN ALLEVIATING THE BIAS CREATED BY CALIBRATING THE MODELS ON THE EXTREME TEMPERATURES AND INCREASED THE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY TO 90.3%. A GLOBAL CALIBRATION METHOD, INCORPORATING ALL FOUR TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS IN THE CLASSIFIER FEATURE SPACE, PROVIDED THE BEST AVERAGE TOTAL CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY OF 92.2% OUT OF THE METHODS STUDIED, AND WAS FAIRLY ROBUST TO THE VARYING DIURNAL TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS.

"NAKARMI A;TANG L";AUTOMATIC INTERPLANT SPACING SENSING AT EARLY GROWTH STAGES USING A 3D VISION SENSOR;AN INTER-PLANT SPACING SENSING SYSTEM USING A TOF (TIME OF FLIGHT) OF LIGHT BASED 3D SENSOR WAS DEVELOPED. THE 3D SENSOR WAS CAPABLE OF CAPTURING DISTANCE INFORMATION, INTENSITY AND AMPLITUDE DATA IN A SINGLE SHOT. THE SIDE VIEW DEPTH IMAGES CAPTURED WERE STITCHED TOGETHER USING DISTANCE INFORMATION FROM A WHEEL ENCODER IN CONJUNCTION WITH A FEATURE-BASED IMAGE SEQUENCING PROCESS FOR THE STEM LOCATION IDENTIFICATION. ONE OBVIOUS ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM OVER CURRENT COLOR-BASED 2D SYSTEMS WAS THE USE OF DEPTH IMAGES FOR PLANT IDENTIFICATION, WHICH WAS LESS SENSITIVE TO COLOR VARIATIONS. A COVERED CART WAS DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE SUNLIGHT FROM DIRECTLY SHEDDING ON THE PLANTS AND TO REDUCE THE INTERFERENCE FROM WIND, WHICH IN TURN MADE THE SYSTEM USABLE THROUGHOUT THE DAY. THE VERTICAL CAMERA POSITION WAS EASILY ADJUSTABLE MAKING THE SYSTEM SUITABLE TO WORK WITH PLANTS AT DIFFERENT GROWTH STAGES. THE USE OF SIDE-VIEW IMAGES MADE THE SYSTEM CAPABLE OF DETECTING INCLINED PLANTS AND THEREFORE, BOOSTED THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SYSTEM IN PRECISELY LOCATING THE STEM CENTERS, WHICH IN TURN MINIMIZED THE MEASUREMENT ERRORS. THE MEASUREMENT ACCURACY DEMONSTRATED THE SYSTEM SUPERIORITY OVER THE CURRENT SYSTEMS WHICH MAKE USE OF TOP-VIEW IMAGES FOR INTER-PLANT SPACING SENSING. THE SYSTEM ACHIEVED AN OVERALL MEAN ROOT MEAN SQUARED ERROR (RMSE) OF 0.017M WITH A MEAN PLANT MISIDENTIFICATION RATIO OF 2.2%.

"GULDENRING R;NALPANTIDIS L";SELFSUPERVISED CONTRASTIVE LEARNING ON AGRICULTURAL IMAGES;AGRICULTURE EMERGES AS A PROMINENT APPLICATION DOMAIN FOR ADVANCED COMPUTER VISION ALGORITHMS. AS MUCH AS DEEP LEARNING APPROACHES CAN HELP SOLVE PROBLEMS SUCH AS PLANT DETECTION, THEY RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF ANNOTATED IMAGES FOR TRAINING. HOWEVER, RELEVANT AGRICULTURAL DATASETS ARE SCARCE AND AT THE SAME TIME, GENERIC WELL-ESTABLISHED IMAGE DATASETS SUCH AS IMAGENET DO NOT NECESSARILY CAPTURE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF AGRICULTURAL ENVIRONMENTS. THIS OBSERVATION HAS MOTIVATED US TO EXPLORE THE APPLICABILITY OF SELF-SUPERVISED CONTRASTIVE LEARNING ON AGRICULTURAL IMAGES. OUR APPROACH CONSIDERS NUMEROUS NON-ANNOTATED AGRICULTURAL IMAGES, WHICH ARE EASY TO OBTAIN, AND USES THEM TO PRE-TRAIN DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS. WE THEN REQUIRE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF ANNOTATED IMAGES TO FINE-TUNE THOSE NETWORKS IN A SUPERVISED TRAINING MANNER FOR RELEVANT DOWNSTREAM TASKS, SUCH AS PLANT CLASSIFICATION OR SEGMENTATION. TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, CONTRASTIVE SELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING HAS NOT BEEN EXPLORED BEFORE IN THE AREA OF AGRICULTURAL IMAGES. OUR RESULTS REVEAL THAT IT OUTPERFORMS CONVENTIONAL DEEP LEARNING APPROACHES IN CLASSIFICATION DOWNSTREAM TASKS, ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL AMOUNTS OF AVAILABLE ANNOTATED TRAINING IMAGES WHERE UP TO 14\% INCREASE OF AVERAGE TOP-1 CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY HAS BEEN OBSERVED.

EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT THE ALGORITHM CAN ADAPT TO MOST DAYTIME CONDITIONS IN OUTDOOR FIELDS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN LIGHT SOURCE TEMPERATURE AND SOIL TYPE. WHEN COMPARED TO A STATIC SEGMENTATION TECHNIQUE WHICH WAS TRAINED UNDER SUNNY CONDITIONS, THE EASA IMPROVED THE IMAGE SEGMENTATION BY CORRECTLY CLASSIFYING 26.9 AND 54.3\% MORE OBJECT PIXELS UNDER PARTIALLY CLOUDY AND OVERCAST CONDITIONS, RESPECTIVELY. THE IMPROVED IMAGE SEGMENTATION OF THE EASA TECHNIQUE ALSO ALLOWED UP TO 32 TIMES MORE PLANT COTYLEDONS TO BE RECOGNIZED (BY LEAF MORPHOLOGY) UNDER OVERCAST LIGHTING CONDITIONS WHEN COMPARED WITH A STATIC SEGMENTATION TECHNIQUE TRAINED UNDER SUNNY CONDITIONS.

THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE APPLICATION OF A NEURAL NETWORK CLASSIFIER TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN 2 AND 3 WEEKS OLD SUNFLOWER PLANTS AND COMMON COCKLEBUR WEEDS OF SIMILAR SIZE, SHAPE AND COLOUR. COLOUR IMAGES WERE OBTAINED BY A DIGITAL CAMERA, IN NATURAL SUNLIGHT. A SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE WAS TO MINIMISE THE SUBSEQUENT IMAGE PROCESSING OPERATIONS NEEDED TO ENHANCE THE IMAGES AND TO EXTRACT THE FEATURES NEEDED BY A BACK PROPAGATION NEURAL NETWORK CLASSIFIER. NEURAL NETWORK STRUCTURES WITH DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF HIDDEN LAYERS AND NEURONS IN THEM WERE TESTED TO FIND THE OPTIMAL CLASSIFIER. THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF CORRECTLY RECOGNISED IMAGES IN DISTINGUISHING WEEDS FROM SUNFLOWER PLANTS WAS 71 (OUT OF 86), WHILE IT WAS 82 AND 74 IN SEPARATING SUNFLOWER AND WEED IMAGES FROM BARE SOIL IMAGES, RESPECTIVELY.

THEREFORE, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ESTIMATE MAIZE POPULATION DENSITY TIMELY AND ACCURATELY. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS OF THE LOW EFFICIENCY OF THE MANUAL COUNTING METHOD AND THE STABILITY PROBLEM OF TRADITIONAL IMAGE PROCESSING METHODS IN THE FIELD COMPLEX BACKGROUND ENVIRONMENT, A DEEP-LEARNING-BASED METHOD FOR COUNTING MAIZE PLANTS WAS PROPOSED. IMAGE DATASETS OF THE MAIZE FIELD WERE COLLECTED BY A LOW-ALTITUDE UAV WITH A CAMERA ONBOARD FIRSTLY. THEN A REAL-TIME DETECTION MODEL OF MAIZE PLANTS WAS TRAINED BASED ON THE OBJECT DETECTION MODEL YOLOV5. FINALLY, THE TRACKING AND COUNTING METHOD OF MAIZE PLANTS WAS REALIZED THROUGH HUNGARIAN MATCHING AND KALMAN FILTERING ALGORITHMS. THE DETECTION MODEL DEVELOPED IN THIS STUDY HAD AN AVERAGE PRECISION MAP@0.5 OF 90.66% ON THE TEST DATASET, DEMONSTRATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SE-YOLOV5M MODEL FOR MAIZE PLANT DETECTION. APPLICATION OF THE MODEL TO MAIZE PLANT COUNT TRIALS SHOWED THAT MAIZE PLANT COUNT RESULTS FROM TEST VIDEOS COLLECTED AT MULTIPLE LOCATIONS WERE HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH MANUAL COUNT RESULTS (R2 = 0.92), ILLUSTRATING THE ACCURACY AND VALIDITY OF THE COUNTING METHOD. THEREFORE, THE MAIZE PLANT IDENTIFICATION AND COUNTING METHOD PROPOSED IN THIS STUDY CAN BETTER ACHIEVE THE DETECTION AND COUNTING OF MAIZE PLANTS IN COMPLEX BACKGROUNDS AND PROVIDES A RESEARCH BASIS AND THEORETICAL BASIS FOR THE RAPID ACQUISITION OF MAIZE PLANT POPULATION DENSITY.

"SALEEM G;AKHTAR M;AHMED N;QURESHI W";AUTOMATED ANALYSIS OF VISUAL LEAF SHAPE FEATURES FOR PLANT CLASSIFICATION;A LARGE NUMBER OF STUDIES HAVE BEEN PERFORMED DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS TO AUTOMATICALLY IDENTIFY THE PLANT TYPE IN A GIVEN IMAGE. BESIDES COMMON OBJECT RECOGNITION DIFFICULTIES ARISING MAINLY DUE TO LIGHT, POSE AND ORIENTATION VARIATIONS, THE PLANT TYPE IDENTIFICATION PROBLEM IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE DIFFERENCES IN LEAF SHAPE OVERAGE AND CHANGING LEAF COLOR UNDER DIFFERENT WEATHER CONDITIONS. THE LIMITED ACCURACY OF EXISTING APPROACHES CAN BE IMPROVED USING AN APPROPRIATE SELECTION OF REPRESENTATIVE LEAF BASED FEATURES. THIS STUDY EVALUATES DIFFERENT HANDCRAFTED VISUAL LEAF FEATURES, THEIR EXTRACTION TECHNIQUES, AND CLASSIFICATION METHODS. TOWARDS THIS END, A NEW FIVE-STEP ALGORITHM IS PRESENTED (COMPRISING IMAGE PRE-PROCESSING, SEGMENTATION, FEATURE EXTRACTION, DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION, AND CLASSIFICATION STEPS) FOR RECOGNITION OF PLANT TYPE THROUGH LEAF IMAGES. THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM IS EVALUATED ON A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE STANDARD DATASET â€˜FLAVIAâ€™ OF 1600 LEAF IMAGES AND ON A SELF-COLLECTED DATASET OF 625 LEAF IMAGES. WITH THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM, DIFFERENT CLASSIFIERS SUCH AS K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR (KNN), DECISION TREE, NAÃVE BAYES, AND MULTI-SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES (SVM) ARE TESTED. THE BEST PERFORMING KNN, CLAIMED FOR THE FINAL RESULTS, REVEALS THAT THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM GIVES PRECISION AND RECALL VALUES OF 97.6% AND 98.8% RESPECTIVELY WHEN TESTED ON â€˜FLAVIAâ€™ DATASET. THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE IS ALSO TESTED ON OUR SELF-COLLECTED DATASET, GIVING RESPECTIVELY 96.1% AND 97.3% PRECISION AND RECALL MEASURE RESULTS. RESULTS CONFIRM THAT OUR APPROACH, WHEN AUGMENTED WITH EFFICIENT SEGMENTATION TECHNIQUES ON RAW LEAF IMAGES, CAN BE A SIGNIFICANTLY ACCURATE PLANT TYPE RECOGNITION METHOD IN PRACTICAL SITUATIONS. ALEXNET, A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) BASED APPROACH IS ALSO COMPARED FOR CLASSIFICATION ON THE DATASETS AS OPPOSE TO HANDCRAFTED FEATURE-BASED APPROACH AND IT IS FOUND THAT THE LATER OUTPERFORMS THE FORMER IN ROBUSTNESS WHEN THE TRAINING DATASET IS SMALL.

"HALSTEAD M;AHMADI A;SMITT C;SCHMITTMANN O;MCCOOL C";CROP AGNOSTIC MONITORING DRIVEN BY DEEP LEARNING;FARMERS REQUIRE DIVERSE AND COMPLEX INFORMATION TO MAKE AGRONOMICAL DECISIONS ABOUT CROP MANAGEMENT INCLUDING INTERVENTION TASKS. GENERALLY, THIS INFORMATION IS GATHERED BY FARMERS TRAVERSING THEIR FIELDS OR GLASSHOUSES WHICH IS OFTEN A TIME CONSUMING AND POTENTIALLY EXPENSIVE PROCESS. IN RECENT YEARS, ROBOTIC PLATFORMS HAVE GAINED SIGNIFICANT TRACTION DUE TO ADVANCES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. HOWEVER, THESE PLATFORMS ARE USUALLY TIED TO ONE SETTING (SUCH AS ARABLE FARMLAND), OR ALGORITHMS ARE DESIGNED FOR A SINGLE PLATFORM. THIS CREATES A SIGNIFICANT GAP BETWEEN AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY AND FARMER REQUIREMENTS. WE PROPOSE A NOVEL FIELD AGNOSTIC MONITORING TECHNIQUE THAT IS ABLE TO OPERATE ON TWO DIFFERENT ROBOTS, IN ARABLE FARMLAND OR A GLASSHOUSE (HORTICULTURAL SETTING). INSTANCE SEGMENTATION FORMS THE BACKBONE OF THIS APPROACH FROM WHICH OBJECT LOCATION AND CLASS, OBJECT AREA, AND YIELD INFORMATION CAN BE OBTAINED. IN ARABLE FARMLAND, OUR SEGMENTATION NETWORK IS ABLE TO ESTIMATE CROP AND WEED AT A SPECIES LEVEL AND IN A GLASSHOUSE WE ARE ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE SWEET PEPPER AND THEIR RIPENESS. FOR YIELD INFORMATION, WE INTRODUCE A NOVEL MATCHING CRITERION THAT REMOVES THE PIXEL-WISE CONSTRAINTS OF PREVIOUS VERSIONS. THIS APPROACH IS ABLE TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF FRUIT (SWEET PEPPER) IN A GLASSHOUSE WITH A NORMALIZED ABSOLUTE ERROR OF 4.7% AND AN R2 OF 0.901 WITH THE VISUAL GROUND TRUTH. WHEN APPLIED TO CLUTTERED ARABLE FARMLAND SCENES IT IMPROVES ON THE PRIOR APPROACH BY 50%.

THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE SUPERIORITY OF MODELS THAT SEPARATE LUMINANCE FROM CHROMINANCE. IN PARTICULAR, L*. A*. B* PROVIDES THE BEST RESULTS WITH A* CHANNEL, PRODUCING A 99.2% OF CORRECT CLASSIFICATION. FURTHER PROCESSING STAGES IMPROVE THIS PERFORMANCE UP TO 99.5% ACCURACY, TAKING LESS THAN 1/3 OF A SECOND PER IMAGE IN A NORMAL LAPTOP.

"LOTTES P;BEHLEY J;CHEBROLU N;MILIOTO A;STACHNISS C";ROBUST JOINT STEM DETECTION AND CROPWEED CLASSIFICATION USING IMAGE SEQUENCES FOR PLANTSPECIFIC TREATMENT IN PRECISION FARMING;CONVENTIONAL FARMING STILL RELIES ON LARGE QUANTITIES OF AGROCHEMICALS FOR WEED MANAGEMENT WHICH HAVE SEVERAL NEGATIVE SIDE-EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT. AUTONOMOUS ROBOTS OFFER THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF CHEMICALS APPLIED, AS ROBOTS CAN MONITOR AND TREAT EACH PLANT IN THE FIELD INDIVIDUALLY AND THEREBY CIRCUMVENTING THE UNIFORM CHEMICAL TREATMENT OF THE WHOLE FIELD. SUCH AGRICULTURAL ROBOTS NEED THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUAL CROPS AND WEEDS IN THE FIELD USING SENSOR DATA AND MUST ADDITIONALLY SELECT EFFECTIVE TREATMENT METHODS BASED ON THE TYPE OF WEED. FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN TYPES OF WEEDS CAN ONLY BE EFFECTIVELY TREATED MECHANICALLY DUE TO THEIR RESISTANCE TO HERBICIDES, WHEREAS OTHER TYPES CAN BE TREATED TROUGH SELECTIVE SPRAYING. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE PRESENT A NOVEL SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES THE NECESSARY INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE PLANT-SPECIFIC TREATMENT. IT ESTIMATES THE STEM LOCATION FOR WEEDS, WHICH ENABLES THE ROBOTS TO PERFORM PRECISE MECHANICAL TREATMENT, AND AT THE SAME TIME PROVIDES THE PIXEL-ACCURATE AREA COVERED BY WEEDS FOR TREATMENT THROUGH SELECTIVE SPRAYING. THE MAJOR CHALLENGE IN DEVELOPING SUCH A SYSTEM IS THE LARGE VARIABILITY IN THE VISUAL APPEARANCE THAT OCCURS IN DIFFERENT FIELDS. THUS, AN EFFECTIVE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM HAS TO ROBUSTLY HANDLE SUBSTANTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES INCLUDING VARYING WEED PRESSURE, VARIOUS WEED TYPES, DIFFERENT GROWTH STAGES, CHANGING VISUAL APPEARANCE OF THE PLANTS AND THE SOIL. OUR APPROACH USES AN END-TO-END TRAINABLE FULLY CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORK THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY ESTIMATES PLANT STEM POSITIONS AS WELL AS THE SPATIAL EXTENT OF CROP PLANTS AND WEEDS. IT JOINTLY LEARNS HOW TO DETECT THE STEMS AND THE PIXEL-WISE SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION AND INCORPORATES SPATIAL INFORMATION BY CONSIDERING IMAGE SEQUENCES OF LOCAL FIELD STRIPS. THE JOINTLY LEARNED FEATURE REPRESENTATION FOR BOTH TASKS FURTHERMORE EXPLOITS THE CROP ARRANGEMENT INFORMATION THAT IS OFTEN PRESENT IN CROP FIELDS. THIS INFORMATION IS CONSIDERED EVEN IF IT IS ONLY OBSERVABLE FROM THE IMAGE SEQUENCES AND NOT A SINGLE IMAGE. SUCH IMAGE SEQUENCES, AS TYPICALLY PROVIDED BY ROBOTS NAVIGATING OVER THE FIELD ALONG CROP ROWS, ENABLE OUR APPROACH TO ROBUSTLY ESTIMATE THE SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION AND STEM POSITIONS DESPITE THE LARGE VARIATIONS ENCOUNTERED IN DIFFERENT FIELDS. WE IMPLEMENTED AND THOROUGHLY TESTED OUR APPROACH ON IMAGES FROM MULTIPLE FARMS IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. THE EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT OUR SYSTEM GENERALIZES WELL TO PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN FIELDS UNDER VARYING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONSâ€”A KEY CAPABILITY TO DEPLOY SUCH SYSTEMS IN THE REAL WORLD. COMPARED TO STATE-OF-THE-ART APPROACHES, OUR APPROACH GENERALIZES WELL TO UNSEEN FIELDS AND NOT ONLY SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVES THE STEM DETECTION ACCURACY, THAT IS, DISTINGUISHING CROP AND WEED STEMS, BUT ALSO IMPROVES THE SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION PERFORMANCE.

HOWEVER, CATEGORIZING LEAF IMAGES AT THE CULTIVAR/VARIETY LEVEL, BECAUSE OF THE VERY LOW INTER-CLASS VARIABILITY, IS STILL A CHALLENGING TASK. IN THIS RESEARCH, WE PROPOSE AN AUTOMATIC DISCRIMINATIVE METHOD BASED ON CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS) FOR CLASSIFYING 12 DIFFERENT CULTIVARS OF COMMON BEANS THAT BELONG TO THREE VARIOUS SPECIES. WE SHOW THAT EMPLOYING ADVANCED LOSS FUNCTIONS, SUCH AS ADDITIVE ANGULAR MARGIN LOSS AND LARGE MARGIN COSINE LOSS, INSTEAD OF THE STANDARD SOFTMAX LOSS FUNCTION FOR THE CLASSIFICATION CAN YIELD BETTER DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN CLASSES AND THEREBY MITIGATE THE PROBLEM OF LOW INTER-CLASS VARIABILITY. THE METHOD WAS EVALUATED BY CLASSIFYING SPECIES (LEVEL I), CULTIVARS FROM THE SAME SPECIES (LEVEL II), AND CULTIVARS FROM DIFFERENT SPECIES (LEVEL III), BASED ON IMAGES FROM THE LEAF FORESIDE AND BACKSIDE. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM ON THE LEAF BACKSIDE IMAGE DATASET IS SUPERIOR. THE MAXIMUM MEAN CLASSIFICATION ACCURACIES OF 95.86, 91.37 AND 86.87% WERE OBTAINED AT THE LEVELS I, II AND III, RESPECTIVELY.

"YIGIT E;SABANCI K;TOKTAS A;KAYABASI A";A STUDY ON VISUAL FEATURES OF LEAVES IN PLANT IDENTIFICATION USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNIQUES;IN THIS PAPER, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNIQUES (AIT) SUCH AS ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK, NAIVE BAYES ALGORITHM, RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM, K-NEAREST NEIGHBORHOOD (KNN) AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) ARE IMPLEMENTED TO DESIGN AN AUTOMATIC IDENTIFIER FOR THE PLANT LEAVES. FOR THIS PURPOSE, DATA OF 637 HEALTHY LEAVES CONSISTING OF 32 DIFFERENT PLANT SPECIES ARE USED. 22 VISUAL FEATURES (VF) OF EACH LEAF ARE EXTRACTED BY USING IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES. THESE 22 VF ARE CONSIDERED IN 4 GROUPS INCLUDING DIMENSION (D#6), COLOR (C#6), TEXTURE (T#5) AND PATTERN (P#5). IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THESE GROUPS ON THE CLASSIFYING PERFORMANCE, 15 POSSIBLE DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS FROM THE 4 GROUPS ARE CONSTITUTED. THE MODELS ARE THEN TRAINED VIA THE DATA OF 510 LEAVES, AND THEIR ACCURACY ARE TESTED THROUGH THE DATA OF 127 LEAVES. FROM THE RESULTS OF THE TEST, SVM MODEL WITH THE ACCURACY OF 92.91% IS FOUND TO BE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL IDENTIFIER FOR COMBINATION INCLUDING ALL GROUPS. THE NEXT BEST RESULT IS ACHIEVED WITH THE ACCURACY OF 87.40% FOR THE COMBINATION OF D#6, C#6 AND P#5 GROUPS. SINCE THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE IN THE CLASSIFICATION PROCESS IS THE USE OF THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF VF, 16 MOST EFFECTIVE VF ON THE IDENTIFICATION ARE DETERMINED BY MEANS OF CORRELATION-BASED FEATURE SELECTION (CFS) METHOD. THE BEST RESULT FOR THESE 16 VF IS ALSO ACHIEVED WITH THE ACCURACY OF 94.49% BY THE SVM MODEL. THEN THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED METHOD IS TESTED TO IDENTIFY THE DISEASED AND DEFECTED LEAVES. THEREFORE, 637 HEALTHY AND 33 DISEASED/DEFECTED LEAVES ARE PUT TOGETHER. RANDOMLY SELECTED 536 LEAVES CORRESPONDING TO 80% OF ALL LEAVES ARE USED FOR TRAINING AND THE REMAINING 134 LEAVES ARE USED FOR TESTING, AND IDENTIFIED WITH THE ACCURACY OF 92.53% BY THE SVM MODEL. WITH THIS STUDY, IT IS NUMERICALLY REVEALED THAT THE P#5 IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE FEATURE GROUP. MOREOVER, IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE FEATURE IN THE P#5 GROUP IS THE FEATURE OF EDGE FOURIER TRANSFORM. THE RESULTS POINT OUT THAT, IF AIT MODELS ARE PROPERLY MODELLED AND TRAINED, THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY AND EFFECTIVELY APPLIED TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE PLANTS EVEN IF THERE ARE DISEASED AND DEFECTED SAMPLES.

THE DEVELOPED SYSTEM OVERCAME THE PREVIOUSLY UNSOLVED PROBLEMS CAUSED BY OCCLUDED CANOPY AND ILLUMINATION VARIATION. AN EFFICIENT NOISE FILTER WAS DEVELOPED TO REMOVE THE SPARSE NOISE POINTS IN 3D POINT CLOUD SPACE. BOTH 2D AND 3D FEATURES INCLUDING THE GRADIENT OF AMPLITUDE AND DEPTH IMAGE, SURFACE CURVATURE, AMPLITUDE PERCENTILE INDEX, NORMAL DIRECTION, AND NEIGHBOR POINT COUNT IN 3D SPACE WERE EXTRACTED AND FOUND EFFECTIVE FOR RECOGNIZING THESE TWO TYPES OF PLANTS. SEPARATE SEGMENTATION ALGORITHMS WERE DEVELOPED FOR EACH OF THE BROCCOLI AND GREEN BEAN PLANT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR 3D GEOMETRY AND 2D AMPLITUDE CHARACTERISTICS. UNDER THE EXPERIMENTAL CONDITION WHERE THE CROPS WERE HEAVILY INFESTED BY VARIOUS TYPES OF WEED PLANTS, DETECTION RATES OVER 88.3% AND 91.2% WERE ACHIEVED FOR BROCCOLI AND GREEN BEAN PLANT LEAVES, RESPECTIVELY.

WITH 2D MACHINE VISION, VARIATION IN OUTDOOR LIGHTING CONDITIONS AND WEEDS IN THE BACKGROUND ALSO POSE DIFFICULTIES IN CORN PLANT IDENTIFICATION. ADDING THE DEPTH DIMENSION HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF SUCH A SENSING SYSTEM. A NEW CORN PLANT SENSING SYSTEM USING A REAL-TIME STEREO VISION SYSTEM WAS INVESTIGATED IN THIS RESEARCH. TOP-VIEW DEPTH IMAGES OF CORN PLANT CANOPY WERE ACQUIRED. BY PROCESSING THE DEPTH IMAGES, THE ALGORITHM EFFECTIVELY UPDATED THE PLANT SKELETON STRUCTURES AND FINALLY RECOGNIZED INDIVIDUAL CORN PLANTS AND DETECTED THEIR CENTER POSITIONS. THE STEREO VISION SYSTEM WAS TESTED OVER CORN PLANTS OF V2-V3 GROWTH STAGES IN BOTH LABORATORY AND FIELD CONDITIONS. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE STEREO VISION SYSTEM WAS CAPABLE OF DETECTING BOTH SEPARATED AND OVERLAPPED CORN PLANTS.

"RETALLACK A;FINLAYSON G;OSTENDORF B;LEWIS M";USING DEEP LEARNING TO DETECT AN INDICATOR ARID SHRUB IN ULTRAHIGHRESOLUTION UAV IMAGERY;"EFFECTIVE MONITORING OF ARID AND SEMI-ARID RANGELANDS AROUND THE WORLD IS ESSENTIAL TO UNDERSTAND AND COMBAT DEGRADATION CAUSED BY ANTHROPOGENIC USE AND FACILITATE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGIES PROVIDE IDEAL APPROACHES FOR ENHANCING TRADITIONAL ON-GROUND MONITORING. HOWEVER, WHILE BROAD-SCALE MONITORING OF VEGETATION IN RANGELANDS USING SATELLITES HAS BEEN WIDELY ADOPTED, THERE HAS BEEN FAR LESS UPTAKE OF REMOTE SENSING FOR MEASURING FINE-SCALE INDICATORS OF ECOSYSTEM CONDITION. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THE FEASIBILITY OF USING ULTRA-HIGH-RESOLUTION UAV (UNCREWED AERIAL VEHICLE) IMAGERY AND DEEP-LEARNING-BASED OBJECT DETECTION MODELS TO PROVIDE PLANT RECOGNITION AND SURVEY INFORMATION RELEVANT FOR OPERATIONAL MONITORING PROGRAMMES IN ARID AND SEMI-ARID ECOSYSTEMS. SEVEN DIFFERENT OBJECT DETECTORS USING VARYING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) ARCHITECTURES ARE TESTED AT THREE IMAGE RESOLUTIONS TO DETECT A WIDESPREAD, DOMINANT ARID SHRUB SPECIES (PEARL BLUEBUSH, MAIREANA SEDIFOLIA) THAT SERVES AS A KEY INDICATOR OF OVERALL SITE CONDITION IN SOUTHERN AUSTRALIAN RANGELANDS. TO MAXIMISE THE STRENGTH OF STATISTICAL ANALYSIS, EACH METHOD IS TRAINED ON SIX DIFFERENT TRAINING DATASETS (EACH USING 2,000 TO 3,000 TRAINING SAMPLES) AT SIX WIDELY DISPERSED SITES. THIS RESULTS IN 90 TRAINED MODELS, EACH VALIDATED AT TWO SITES. TO TEST MODEL GENERALISABILITY, TRAINING AND VALIDATION DATA WAS ALWAYS SOURCED FROM SEPARATE VEGETATION MONITORING SITES. THE INFLUENCE OF VARIABILITY BETWEEN SITES ON DETECTION ACCURACY IS ALSO CONSIDERED. THE BEST PERFORMING MODELS ACHIEVED F1 SCORES (OVERALL ACCURACY) OF AROUND 75% FOR PEARL BLUEBUSH DETECTION, A LEVEL OF ACCURACY THAT PROVIDES USEFUL MONITORING INFORMATION TO LAND MANAGERS. INFORMATION EXTRACTED FROM UAV IMAGERY USING THIS APPROACH RELATES DIRECTLY TO INDICATORS OF ECOLOGICAL CONDITION MEASURED IN GROUND-BASED MONITORING; INCLUDING DOMINANT PLANT SPECIES COUNT, LOCATION AND DENSITY.

THUS, COLOR IS ALSO USED IN FLOWER-IMAGE CLASSIFICATION. COLOR LABELS, SUCH AS 'GREEN', 'RED', AND 'YELLOW', ARE USED BY TAXONOMISTS AND LAY PEOPLE ALIKE TO DESCRIBE THE COLOR OF PLANTS. FLOWER IMAGE DATASETS USUALLY ONLY CONSIST OF IMAGES AND DO NOT CONTAIN FLOWER DESCRIPTIONS. IN THIS RESEARCH, WE HAVE BUILT A FLOWER-IMAGE DATASET, ESPECIALLY REGARDING ORCHID SPECIES, WHICH CONSISTS OF HUMAN-FRIENDLY TEXTUAL DESCRIPTIONS OF FEATURES OF SPECIFIC FLOWERS, ON THE ONE HAND, AND DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHS INDICATING HOW A FLOWER LOOKS LIKE, ON THE OTHER HAND. USING THIS DATASET, A NEW AUTOMATED COLOR DETECTION MODEL WAS DEVELOPED. IT IS THE FIRST RESEARCH OF ITS KIND USING COLOR LABELS AND DEEP LEARNING FOR COLOR DETECTION IN FLOWER RECOGNITION. AS DEEP LEARNING OFTEN EXCELS IN PATTERN RECOGNITION IN DIGITAL IMAGES, WE APPLIED TRANSFER LEARNING WITH VARIOUS AMOUNTS OF UNFREEZING OF LAYERS WITH FIVE DIFFERENT NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURES (VGG16, INCEPTION, RESNET50, XCEPTION, NASNET) TO DETERMINE WHICH ARCHITECTURE AND WHICH SCHEME OF TRANSFER LEARNING PERFORMS BEST. IN ADDITION, VARIOUS COLOR SCHEME SCENARIOS WERE TESTED, INCLUDING THE USE OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY COLOR TOGETHER, AND, IN ADDITION, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DEALING WITH MULTI-CLASS CLASSIFICATION USING MULTI-CLASS, COMBINED BINARY, AND, FINALLY, ENSEMBLE CLASSIFIERS WERE STUDIED. THE BEST OVERALL PERFORMANCE WAS ACHIEVED BY THE ENSEMBLE CLASSIFIER. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED METHOD CAN DETECT THE COLOR OF FLOWER AND LABELLUM VERY WELL WITHOUT HAVING TO PERFORM IMAGE SEGMENTATION.

IN THE RECENT YEARS, DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES AND IN PARTICULAR CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS), RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS AND LONG-SHORT TERM MEMORIES (LSTMS), HAVE SHOWN GREAT SUCCESS IN VISUAL DATA RECOGNITION, CLASSIFICATION, AND SEQUENCE LEARNING TASKS. MORE RECENTLY, CNNS HAVE BEEN USED FOR PLANT CLASSIFICATION AND PHENOTYPING, USING INDIVIDUAL STATIC IMAGES OF THE PLANTS. ON THE OTHER HAND, DYNAMIC BEHAVIOR OF THE PLANTS AS WELL AS THEIR GROWTH HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT PHENOTYPE FOR PLANT BIOLOGISTS, AND THIS MOTIVATED US TO STUDY THE POTENTIAL OF LSTMS IN ENCODING THESE TEMPORAL INFORMATION FOR THE ACCESSION CLASSIFICATION TASK, WHICH IS USEFUL IN AUTOMATION OF PLANT PRODUCTION AND CARE. METHODS: IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A CNN-LSTM FRAMEWORK FOR PLANT CLASSIFICATION OF VARIOUS GENOTYPES. HERE, WE EXPLOIT THE POWER OF DEEP CNNS FOR AUTOMATIC JOINT FEATURE AND CLASSIFIER LEARNING, COMPARED TO USING HAND-CRAFTED FEATURES. IN ADDITION, WE LEVERAGE THE POTENTIAL OF LSTMS TO STUDY THE GROWTH OF THE PLANTS AND THEIR DYNAMIC BEHAVIORS AS IMPORTANT DISCRIMINATIVE PHENOTYPES FOR ACCESSION CLASSIFICATION.

"LIU K;YANG M;HUANG S;LIN C";PLANT SPECIES CLASSIFICATION BASED ON HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGING VIA A LIGHTWEIGHT CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK MODEL;IN RECENT YEARS, MANY IMAGE-BASED APPROACHES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO CLASSIFY PLANT SPECIES. MOST METHODS UTILIZED RED GREEN BLUE (RGB) IMAGING MATERIALS AND DESIGNED CUSTOM FEATURES TO CLASSIFY THE PLANT IMAGES USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS. THOSE WORKS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON ANALYZING SINGLE-LEAF IMAGES INSTEAD OF LIVE-CROWN IMAGES. WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE ADDITIONAL FEATURES OF THE LEAVESâ€™ COLOR AND SPATIAL PATTERN, THEY FAILED TO HANDLE CASES THAT CONTAINED LEAVES SIMILAR IN APPEARANCE DUE TO THE LIMITED SPECTRAL INFORMATION OF RGB IMAGING. TO TACKLE THIS DILEMMA, THIS STUDY PROPOSES A NOVEL FRAMEWORK THAT COMBINES HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGING (HSI) AND DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES FOR PLANT IMAGE CLASSIFICATION. WE BUILT A PLANT IMAGE DATASET CONTAINING 1,500 IMAGES OF 30 DIFFERENT PLANT SPECIES TAKEN BY A 470â€“900 NM HYPERSPECTRAL CAMERA AND DESIGNED A LIGHTWEIGHT CONVENTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) MODEL (LTCNN) TO PERFORM IMAGE CLASSIFICATION. SEVERAL STATE-OF-ART CNN CLASSIFIERS ARE CHOSEN FOR COMPARISON. THE IMPACT OF USING DIFFERENT BAND COMBINATIONS AS THE NETWORK INPUT IS ALSO INVESTIGATED. RESULTS SHOW THAT USING SIMULATED RGB IMAGES ACHIEVES A KAPPA COEFFICIENT OF NEARLY 0.90 WHILE USING THE COMBINATION OF 3-BAND RGB AND 3-BAND NEAR-INFRARED IMAGES CAN IMPROVE TO 0.95. IT IS ALSO FOUND THAT THE PROPOSED LTCNN CAN OBTAIN A SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE OF PLANT CLASSIFICATION (KAPPA = 0.95) USING CRITICAL SPECTRAL FEATURES OF THE GREEN EDGE (591 NM), RED-EDGE (682 NM), AND NEAR-INFRARED (762 NM) BANDS. THIS STUDY ALSO DEMONSTRATES THE EXCELLENT ADAPTABILITY OF THE LTCNN MODEL IN RECOGNIZING LEAF FEATURES OF PLANT LIVE-CROWN IMAGES WHILE USING A RELATIVELY SMALLER NUMBER OF TRAINING SAMPLES THAN COMPLEX CNN MODELS SUCH AS ALEXNET, GOOGLENET, AND VGGNET.

"RZANNY M;WITTICH H;MÃ„DER P;DEGGELMANN A;BOHO D;WÃ„LDCHEN J";IMAGEBASED AUTOMATED RECOGNITION OF 31 POACEAE SPECIES THE MOST RELEVANT PERSPECTIVES;POACEAE REPRESENT ONE OF THE LARGEST PLANT FAMILIES IN THE WORLD. MANY SPECIES ARE OF GREAT ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE AS FOOD AND FORAGE PLANTS WHILE OTHERS REPRESENT IMPORTANT WEEDS IN AGRICULTURE. ALTHOUGH A LARGE NUMBER OF STUDIES CURRENTLY ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF HOW PLANTS CAN BE BEST RECOGNIZED ON IMAGES, THERE IS A LACK OF STUDIES EVALUATING SPECIFIC APPROACHES FOR UNIFORM SPECIES GROUPS CONSIDERED DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY BECAUSE THEY LACK OBVIOUS VISUAL CHARACTERISTICS. POACEAE REPRESENT AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH A SPECIES GROUP, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ARE NON-FLOWERING. HERE WE PRESENT THE RESULTS FROM AN EXPERIMENT TO AUTOMATICALLY IDENTIFY POACEAE SPECIES BASED ON IMAGES DEPICTING SIX WELL-DEFINED PERSPECTIVES. ONE PERSPECTIVE SHOWS THE INFLORESCENCE WHILE THE OTHERS SHOW VEGETATIVE PARTS OF THE PLANT SUCH AS THE COLLAR REGION WITH THE LIGULE, ADAXIAL AND ABAXIAL SIDE OF THE LEAF AND CULM NODES. FOR EACH SPECIES WE COLLECTED 80 OBSERVATIONS, EACH REPRESENTING A SERIES OF SIX IMAGES TAKEN WITH A SMARTPHONE CAMERA. WE EXTRACT FEATURE REPRESENTATIONS FROM THE IMAGES USING FIVE DIFFERENT CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNN) TRAINED ON OBJECTS FROM DIFFERENT DOMAINS AND CLASSIFY THEM USING FOUR STATE-OF-THE ART CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS. WE COMBINE THESE PERSPECTIVES VIA SCORE LEVEL FUSION. IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL OF IDENTIFYING NON-FLOWERING POACEAE WE SEPARATELY COMPARED PERSPECTIVE COMBINATIONS EITHER COMPRISING INFLORESCENCES OR NOT. WE FIND THAT FOR A FUSION OF ALL SIX PERSPECTIVES, USING THE BEST COMBINATION OF FEATURE EXTRACTION CNN AND CLASSIFIER, AN ACCURACY OF 96.1% CAN BE ACHIEVED. WITHOUT THE INFLORESCENCE, THE OVERALL ACCURACY IS STILL AS HIGH AS 90.3%. IN ALL BUT ONE CASE THE PERSPECTIVE CONVEYING THE MOST INFORMATION ABOUT THE SPECIES (EXCLUDING INFLORESCENCE) IS THE LIGULE IN FRONTAL VIEW. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT EVEN SPECIES CONSIDERED VERY DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY CAN ACHIEVE HIGH ACCURACIES IN AUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION AS LONG AS IMAGES DEPICTING SUITABLE PERSPECTIVES ARE AVAILABLE. WE SUGGEST THAT OUR APPROACH COULD BE TRANSFERRED TO OTHER DIFFICULT-TO-DISTINGUISH SPECIES GROUPS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THE MOST RELEVANT PERSPECTIVES.

THIS STUDY PROPOSES A METHOD OF IMPROVING ROBUSTNESS IN SHAPE-BASED CLASSIFYING OF SEEDLINGS TOWARD NATURAL SHAPE VARIATIONS WITHIN EACH PLANT SPECIES. TO DO SO, LEAVES ARE SEPARATED FROM PLANTS AND CLASSIFIED INDIVIDUALLY TOGETHER WITH THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE WHOLE PLANT. THE CLASSIFICATION IS BASED ON COMMON, ROTATION-INVARIANT FEATURES. BASED ON PREVIOUS CLASSIFICATIONS OF LEAVES AND PLANTS, CONFIDENCE IN CORRECT ASSIGNMENT IS CREATED FOR THE PLANTS AND LEAVES, AND THIS CONFIDENCE IS USED TO DETERMINE THE SPECIES OF THE PLANT. BY USING THIS APPROACH, THE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY OF EIGHT PLANTS SPECIES AT EARLY GROWTH STAGES IS INCREASED FROM 93.9% TO 96.3%.

"RZANNY M;MÃ„DER P;DEGGELMANN A;CHEN M;WÃ„LDCHEN J";FLOWERS LEAVES OR BOTH HOW TO OBTAIN SUITABLE IMAGES FOR AUTOMATED PLANT IDENTIFICATION;BACKGROUND: DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR AUTOMATED PLANT IDENTIFICATION NEED LARGE QUANTITIES OF PRECISELY LABELLED IMAGES IN ORDER TO PRODUCE RELIABLE CLASSIFICATION RESULTS. HERE, WE EXPLORE WHAT KIND OF PERSPECTIVES AND THEIR COMBINATIONS CONTAIN MORE CHARACTERISTIC INFORMATION AND THEREFORE ALLOW FOR HIGHER IDENTIFICATION ACCURACY. RESULTS: WE DEVELOPED AN IMAGE-CAPTURING SCHEME TO CREATE OBSERVATIONS OF FLOWERING PLANTS. EACH OBSERVATION COMPRISES FIVE IN-SITU IMAGES OF THE SAME INDIVIDUAL FROM PREDEFINED PERSPECTIVES (ENTIRE PLANT, FLOWER FRONTAL- AND LATERAL VIEW, LEAF TOP- AND BACK SIDE VIEW). WE COLLECTED A COMPLETELY BALANCED DATASET COMPRISING 100 OBSERVATIONS FOR EACH OF 101 SPECIES WITH AN EMPHASIS ON GROUPS OF CONSPECIFIC AND VISUALLY SIMILAR SPECIES INCLUDING TWELVE POACEAE SPECIES. WE USED THIS DATASET TO TRAIN CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS AND DETERMINE THE PREDICTION ACCURACY FOR EACH SINGLE PERSPECTIVE AND THEIR COMBINATIONS VIA SCORE LEVEL FUSION. TOP-1 ACCURACIES RANGED BETWEEN 77% (ENTIRE PLANT) AND 97% (FUSION OF ALL PERSPECTIVES) WHEN AVERAGED ACROSS SPECIES. FLOWER FRONTAL VIEW ACHIEVED THE HIGHEST ACCURACY (88%). FUSING FLOWER FRONTAL, FLOWER LATERAL AND LEAF TOP VIEWS YIELDS THE MOST REASONABLE COMPROMISE WITH RESPECT TO ACQUISITION EFFORT AND ACCURACY (96%). THE PERSPECTIVE ACHIEVING THE HIGHEST ACCURACY WAS SPECIES DEPENDENT.

"RZANNY M;SEELAND M;WÃ„LDCHEN J;MÃ„DER P";ACQUIRING AND PREPROCESSING LEAF IMAGES FOR AUTOMATED PLANT IDENTIFICATION UNDERSTANDING THE TRADEOFF BETWEEN EFFORT AND INFORMATION GAIN;BACKGROUND: AUTOMATED SPECIES IDENTIFICATION IS A LONG TERM RESEARCH SUBJECT. CONTRARY TO FLOWERS AND FRUITS, LEAVES ARE AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE YEAR. OFFERING MARGIN AND TEXTURE TO CHARACTERIZE A SPECIES, THEY ARE THE MOST STUDIED ORGAN FOR AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION. SUBSTANTIALLY MATURED MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES GENERATE THE NEED FOR MORE TRAINING DATA (AKA LEAF IMAGES). RESEARCHERS AS WELL AS ENTHUSIASTS MISS GUIDANCE ON HOW TO ACQUIRE SUITABLE TRAINING IMAGES IN AN EFFICIENT WAY. METHODS: IN THIS PAPER, WE SYSTEMATICALLY STUDY NINE IMAGE TYPES AND THREE PREPROCESSING STRATEGIES. IMAGE TYPES VARY IN TERMS OF IN-SITU IMAGE RECORDING CONDITIONS: PERSPECTIVE, ILLUMINATION, AND BACKGROUND, WHILE THE PREPROCESSING STRATEGIES COMPARE NON-PREPROCESSED, CROPPED, AND SEGMENTED IMAGES TO EACH OTHER. PER IMAGE TYPE-PREPROCESSING COMBINATION, WE ALSO QUANTIFY THE MANUAL EFFORT REQUIRED FOR THEIR IMPLEMENTATION. WE EXTRACT IMAGE FEATURES USING A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK, CLASSIFY SPECIES USING THE RESULTING FEATURE VECTORS AND DISCUSS CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY IN RELATION TO THE REQUIRED EFFORT PER COMBINATION. RESULTS: THE MOST EFFECTIVE, NON-DESTRUCTIVE WAY TO RECORD HERBACEOUS LEAVES IS TO TAKE AN IMAGE OF THE LEAF'S TOP SIDE. WE YIELD THE HIGHEST CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY USING DESTRUCTIVE BACK LIGHT IMAGES, I.E., HOLDING THE PLUCKED LEAF AGAINST THE SKY FOR IMAGE ACQUISITION. CROPPING THE IMAGE TO THE LEAF'S BOUNDARY SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVES ACCURACY, WHILE PRECISE SEGMENTATION YIELDS SIMILAR ACCURACY AT A SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER EFFORT. THE PERMANENT USE OR DISUSE OF A FLASH LIGHT HAS NEGLIGIBLE EFFECTS. IMAGING THE TYPICALLY STRONGER TEXTURED BACKSIDE OF A LEAF DOES NOT RESULT IN HIGHER ACCURACY, BUT NOTABLY INCREASES THE ACQUISITION COST. CONCLUSIONS: IN CONCLUSION, THE WAY IN WHICH LEAF IMAGES ARE ACQUIRED AND PREPROCESSED DOES HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL EFFECT ON THE ACCURACY OF THE CLASSIFIER TRAINED ON THEM.

REGARDING THE BALANCE BETWEEN ACCURACY OF INSPECTION AND COMPACTNESS FOR INFIELD APPLICATIONS, MULTISPECTRAL IMAGING SYSTEMS WOULD BE MORE SUITABLE THAN RGB COLOUR CAMERAS OR HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGING SYSTEMS. MULTISPECTRAL IMAGE REGISTRATION (MIR) IS A KEY ISSUE FOR MULTISPECTRAL IMAGING SYSTEMS, HOWEVER, THIS TASK IS CHALLENGING. FIRST OF ALL, IN MANY CASES, TWO IMAGES NEEDING REGISTRATION DO NOT HAVE A ONE-TO-ONE LINEAR MAPPING IN 2D SPACE AND THEREFORE THEY CANNOT BE ALIGNED IN 2D IMAGES. FURTHERMORE, THE GENERAL MIR ALGORITHMS ARE LIMITED TO IMAGES WITH UNIFORM INTENSITY AND ARE INCAPABLE OF REGISTERING IMAGES WITH RICH FEATURES. THIS STUDY DEVELOPED A MACHINE VISION SYSTEM (MVS) AND A MIR METHOD WHICH REPLACES 2D-2D IMAGE REGISTRATION BY 3D-3D POINT CLOUD REGISTRATION. THE SYSTEM CAN REGISTER 3D POINT CLOUDS OF ULTRAVIOLET (UV), BLUE, GREEN, RED AND NEAR-INFRARED (NIR) SPECTRA IN 3D SPACE. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE POINT CLOUDS OF GENERAL PLANTS CREATED BY IMAGES OF DIFFERENT SPECTRAL BANDS HAVE A COMPLEMENTARY PROPERTY, AND THEREFORE A COMBINED POINT CLOUD, CALLED MULTISPECTRAL 3D POINT CLOUD, IS DENSER THAN ANY CLOUD CREATED BY A SINGLE SPECTRAL BAND. INTENSITY INFORMATION OF EACH SPECTRAL BAND IS AVAILABLE IN A MULTISPECTRAL 3D POINT CLOUD AND THEREFORE IMAGE FUSION AND 3D MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS CAN BE CONDUCTED IN THE CLOUD.

IMPROVED DEEP BELIEF NETWORKS (DBNS) WITH DROPOUT, WHICH USE PROPORTION INTEGRATION DIFFERENTIATION CONTROL (PID) TO DECREASE THE RECONSTRUCTION ERROR IN THE PROCESS OF PRE-TRAINING, ARE USED AS THE CLASSIFIERS. THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM WAS TESTED ON THE ICL DATASET, AND THE AVERAGE RECOGNITION RATE IS 93.9% FOR 220 TYPES OF LEAVES. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED METHOD HAS A HIGHER RECOGNITION RATE AND IS MORE ROBUST THAN THE TRADITIONAL METHODS, AND THE TRAINING PROCESS IS COMPLETED IN A SHORTER TIME.

PLANT RECOGNITION USING CNNS IS ONE OF THE ACTIVE DEEP LEARNING RESEARCH TOPICS DUE TO ITS ADDED-VALUE IN DIFFERENT RELATED FIELDS, ESPECIALLY ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION AND NATURAL AREAS PRESERVATION. AUTOMATIC RECOGNITION OF PLANTS IN PROTECTED AREAS HELPS IN THE SURVEILLANCE PROCESS OF THESE ZONES AND ENSURES THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THEIR ECOSYSTEMS. IN THIS WORK, WE PROPOSE AN ENHANCED RANDOMLY INITIALIZED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (ERI-CNN) FOR THE RECOGNITION OF COLUMNAR CACTUS, WHICH IS AN ENDEMIC PLANT THAT EXISTS IN THE TEHUACÃN-CUICATLÃN VALLEY IN SOUTHEASTERN MEXICO. WE USED A PUBLIC DATASET CREATED BY A GROUP OF RESEARCHERS THAT CONSISTS OF MORE THAN 20000 REMOTE SENSING IMAGES. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS CONFIRM THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROPOSED MODEL COMPARED TO OTHER MODELS REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE LIKE INCEPTIONV3 AND THE MODIFIED LENET-5 CNN.

"AUGUSTINE A;SHERLY K";VARIOUS APPROACHES IN PLANT SPECIES IDENTIFICATION AND PLANT DISEASE DETECTION USING DIGITAL IMAGES OF LEAVES;PLANTS AND TREES ARE AN INEVITABLE PART OF OUR LIFE. ALL THESE SPECIES CONTRIBUTE TO BIODIVERSITY, PROVIDE CLEAN AND FRESH AIR, PREVENT SOIL EROSION, HOME REMEDY, AND MANY MORE. ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SPECIES IS ESSENTIAL FOR PROTECTING BIODIVERSITY. THE IDENTIFICATION OF PLANTS BY CONVENTIONAL METHODS IS COMPLEX AND TIME-CONSUMING FOR NOVICES. ALSO, MANY SPECIES ARE ENDANGERED BECAUSE OF HUMAN ENCROACHMENT AND DUE TO DISEASES AFFECTING PLANTS. THESE PLANT DISEASES CAUSE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND ECOLOGICAL LOSSES. IN THIS CONTEXT, DIAGNOSING DISEASES ACCURATELY AND TIMELY AND DOING THE NECESSARY CONTROL MEASURES IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS IN THE AREA OF COMPUTER VISION TO IDENTIFY PLANT SPECIES AND DISEASES AUTOMATICALLY. THIS PAPER AIMS TO PRESENT VARIOUS APPROACHES IN LEAF RECOGNITION AND DISEASE DETECTION USING DIGITAL IMAGES OF LEAVES. VARIOUS PHASES IN IMAGE CLASSIFICATION USING CONVENTIONAL MACHINE LEARNING MODELS AND DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED.

RICE ROW DETECTION LAYS THE FOUNDATION FOR VISION NAVIGATION WHILE ALSO PRESENTING CHALLENGES. ONE CRUCIAL ISSUE HINDERING FURTHER IMPROVEMENT IN RICE ROW DETECTION PERFORMANCE IS THE IRREGULAR GROWTH MORPHOLOGY OF RICE PLANTS. RICE LEAVES' DIVERGENT GROWTH POSTURES AND UNEVEN ORIENTATIONS MAKE IT CHALLENGING TO ACCURATELY DETERMINE THE ACTUAL GROWTH SITE OF RICE SEEDLINGS. IN THIS STUDY, RICE STEMS, WHICH MAINTAIN A MORE STABLE GROWTH POSTURE THAN THE LEAVES, WERE USED AS THE PRIMARY RECOGNITION OBJECTS TO ELIMINATE THE INTERFERENCE CAUSED BY RICE LEAVES, THEREBY PROMOTING RICE ROW DETECTION ACCURACY. TRANSFORMER-BASED SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION MODELS WERE ADOPTED TO IDENTIFY TRIANGULAR MORPHOLOGICAL MASKS ON THE STEM OF INDIVIDUAL RICE SEEDLINGS. THE ANCHOR POINTS REPRESENTING THE GROUND-BREAKING POSITION OF RICE SEEDLINGS WERE THEN CALCULATED FROM THE PREDICTED STEM MASKS. A DYNAMIC SEARCH DIRECTION-BASED CLUSTERING ALGORITHM WAS PRESENTED TO GROUP THE SPARSELY DISTRIBUTED ANCHOR POINTS INTO ROWS AND COMPLETE THE ROW FITTING SIMULTANEOUSLY. THE PROPOSED STEM-RECOGNITION-BASED METHOD ACHIEVED AN EXCELLENT RICE ROW DETECTION PERFORMANCE WITH UP TO 92.93% DETECTION ACCURACY UNDER COMPLEX NATURAL CONDITIONS, WHICH WAS FAR SUPERIOR TO THE 16.36% OBTAINED BY THE LEAF-RECOGNITION-BASED APPROACH.

A CERTAIN DEGREE OF RESIDUE AND VEGETATION COVER REDUCES EROSION SIGNIFICANTLY AND HAS POSITIVE EFFECTS ON PLANT DEVELOPMENT. IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THESE POSITIVE EFFECTS, IT IS NECESSARY TO MEASURE AND CONTROL THE AMOUNT OF SOIL COVER ON FIELDS. MANUAL MEASUREMENT METHODS ARE TIME CONSUMING AND/OR SUBJECTIVE. AVAILABLE IMAGE ANALYSIS METHODS OFTEN LACK OF GENERALISATION AND ACCURACY. MANY APPROACHES ONLY FOCUS ON RESIDUE OR ON VEGETATION COVER AND DO NOT CONSIDER DIFFERENT CAMERA HARDWARE.

SIMPLE AND EFFICIENT PIXEL-WISE COMPARISONS TO NEIGHBOURING PIXELS ARE INTEGRATED AS DECISION-FEATURES INTO THE RANDOM FOREST. TO VALIDATE OUR METHOD, THE RESULT OF THE AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION WAS COMPARED WITH RESULTS OF MANUAL CLASSIFICATIONS FROM EVALUATORS ON IMAGE GRID POINTS.

THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN APPROACH FOR GENERATING ARTIFICIAL IMAGE SAMPLES OF PLANT SEEDLINGS USING GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS (GAN) TO ALLEVIATE FOR THE LACK OF TRAINING DATA FOR DEEP LEARNING SYSTEMS IN THIS DOMAIN. WE SHOW THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO USE GAN TO PRODUCE SAMPLES THAT ARE VISUALLY DISTINCT ACROSS NINE DIFFERENT PLANTS SPECIES AND MAINTAIN A HIGH AMOUNT VARIANCE WITHIN EACH SPECIES. THE GENERATED SAMPLES RESEMBLE THE INTENDED SPECIES WITH AN AVERAGE RECOGNITION ACCURACY OF 58.9 +/- 9.2\%, EVALUATED USING A STATE-OF-THE-ART CLASSIFICATION MODEL. THE OBSERVED ERRORS ARE RELATED TO SAMPLES REPRESENTING SPECIES WHICH ARE RELATIVELY ANONYMOUS AT THE DICOTYLEDONOUS GROWTH STAGE AND TO THE MODEL'S INCAPABILITY TO REPRODUCE SMALL SHAPE DETAILS. THE ARTIFICIAL PLANT SAMPLES ARE ALSO USED FOR PRETRAINING A CLASSIFICATION MODEL, WHICH IS FINE-TUNED USING REAL DATA. THE PRETRAINED MODEL ACHIEVES 62.0 +/- 5.3\% ACCURACY ON CLASSIFYING REAL PLANT SEEDLINGS PRIOR TO ANY FINETUNING, THUS PROVIDING A STRONG BASIS FOR FURTHER TRAINING.

HERE WE PRESENT RESULTS WHICH DRAW ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THE REAPPEARANCE OF IRRELEVANT AND UNATTENDED BACKGROUND CONTEXTS OF ENCODING SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIRS MEMORY DISCRIMINATION FUNCTIONS. THIS MANUSCRIPT PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF TWO EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH PARTICIPANTS MADE INDOOR/OUTDOOR JUDGEMENTS FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF OBJECT IMAGES PRESENTED TOGETHER WITH INDIVIDUAL, IRRELEVANT AND PRESUMABLY UNATTENDED BACKGROUND SCENES. ON A SUBSEQUENT UNEXPECTED RECOGNITION TEST PARTICIPANTS SAW THE INCIDENTALLY ENCODED TARGET OBJECTS, VISUALLY SIMILAR LURES OR NEW FOIL OBJECTS ON THE SAME OR NEW BACKGROUND SCENES. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT ALTHOUGH THE REAPPEARANCE OF THE BACKGROUND SCENE RAISED THE HIT RATE FOR TARGET OBJECTS, IT DECREASED MNEMONIC DISCRIMINATION, A BEHAVIORAL SCORE FOR PATTERN SEPARATION, A HIPPOCAMPAL FUNCTION THAT IS AFFECTED IN EARLY DEMENTIA. FURTHERMORE, THE PRESENCE OF THE ENCODED BACKGROUND SCENE AT THE RECOGNITION TEST INCREASED THE FALSE RECOGNITION OF LURE OBJECTS, EVEN WHEN PARTICIPANTS WERE EXPLICITLY INSTRUCTED TO NEGLECT THE CONTEXT SCENE. ALTOGETHER THESE RESULTS GAVE EVIDENCE THAT IF CONTEXT INCREASES RECOGNITION HITS FOR TARGET MEMORIES, IT DOES SO AT THE COST OF INCREASING FALSE RECOGNITION AND DIMINISHED DISCRIMINABILITY FOR SIMILAR INFORMATION.

THE LEAFSNAP IS THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL MOBILE APPLICATION SYSTEM WHICH TACKLES THIS PROBLEM. HOWEVER, THE LEAFSNAP IS BASED ON THE IOS PLATFORM. AND TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, AS THE MOBILE OPERATION SYSTEM, THE ANDROID IS MORE POPULAR THAN THE IOS. IN THIS PAPER, AN ANDROID-BASED MOBILE APPLICATION DESIGNED TO AUTOMATICALLY IDENTIFY PLANT SPECIES ACCORDING TO THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF TREE LEAVES IS DESCRIBED. IN THIS APPLICATION, ONE LEAF IMAGE CAN BE EITHER A DIGITAL IMAGE FROM ONE EXISTING LEAF IMAGE DATABASE OR A PICTURE COLLECTED BY A CAMERA. THE PICTURE SHOULD BE A SINGLE LEAF PLACED ON A LIGHT AND UNTEXTURED BACKGROUND WITHOUT OTHER CLUTTER. THE IDENTIFICATION PROCESS CONSISTS OF THREE STEPS: LEAF IMAGE SEGMENTATION, FEATURE EXTRACTION, AND SPECIES IDENTIFICATION. THE DEMO SYSTEM IS EVALUATED ON THE IMAGECLEF2012 PLANT IDENTIFICATION DATABASE WHICH CONTAINS 126 TREE SPECIES FROM THE FRENCH MEDITERRANEAN AREA.

"YOVEL Y;FRANZ M;STILZ P;SCHNITZLER H";PLANT CLASSIFICATION FROM BATLIKE ECHOLOCATION SIGNALS;CLASSIFICATION OF PLANTS ACCORDING TO THEIR ECHOES IS AN ELEMENTARY COMPONENT OF BAT BEHAVIOR THAT PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN SPATIAL ORIENTATION AND FOOD ACQUISITION. VEGETATION ECHOES ARE, HOWEVER, HIGHLY COMPLEX STOCHASTIC SIGNALS: FROM AN ACOUSTICAL POINT OF VIEW, A PLANT CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS A THREE-DIMENSIONAL ARRAY OF LEAVES REFLECTING THE EMITTED BAT CALL. THE RECEIVED ECHO IS THEREFORE A SUPERPOSITION OF MANY REFLECTIONS. IN THIS WORK WE SUGGEST THAT THE CLASSIFICATION OF THESE ECHOES MIGHT NOT BE SUCH A TROUBLESOME ROUTINE FOR BATS AS FORMERLY THOUGHT. WE PRESENT A RATHER SIMPLE APPROACH TO CLASSIFYING SIGNALS FROM A LARGE DATABASE OF PLANT ECHOES THAT WERE CREATED BY ENSONIFYING PLANTS WITH A FREQUENCY-MODULATED BAT-LIKE ULTRASONIC PULSE. OUR ALGORITHM USES THE SPECTROGRAM OF A SINGLE ECHO FROM WHICH IT ONLY USES FEATURES THAT ARE UNDOUBTEDLY ACCESSIBLE TO BATS. WE USED A STANDARD MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM (SVM) TO AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACT SUITABLE LINEAR COMBINATIONS OF TIME AND FREQUENCY CUES FROM THE SPECTROGRAMS SUCH THAT CLASSIFICATION WITH HIGH ACCURACY IS ENABLED. THIS DEMONSTRATES THAT ULTRASONIC ECHOES ARE HIGHLY INFORMATIVE ABOUT THE SPECIES MEMBERSHIP OF AN ENSONIFIED PLANT, AND THAT THIS INFORMATION CAN BE EXTRACTED WITH RATHER SIMPLE, BIOLOGICALLY PLAUSIBLE ANALYSIS. THUS, OUR FINDINGS PROVIDE A NEW EXPLANATORY BASIS FOR THE POORLY UNDERSTOOD OBSERVED ABILITIES OF BATS IN CLASSIFYING VEGETATION AND OTHER COMPLEX OBJECTS.

IN THE PRESENT STUDY, LEAVES OF OAT (AVENA SATIVA) AND DANDELION (TARAXACUM OFFICINALE, TAROF) WERE ARRANGED SO THAT THERE WAS OVERLAP BETWEEN THE SPECIES, IMAGED WITH A PULSE AMPLITUDE MODULATION FLUORESCENCE CAMERA AND PHOTOGRAPHED WITH A DIGITAL COLOR CAMERA. THE FLUORESCENCE INDUCTION CURVES FROM EACH PIXEL WERE PARAMETERIZED TO OBTAIN A SET OF FEATURES AND FROM COLOR PHOTOGRAPHS, TEXTURE FEATURES WERE CALCULATED. A SUPPORT VECTOR ALGORITHM THAT ALSO PERFORMED FEATURE SELECTION WAS USED FOR PATTERN RECOGNITION OF BOTH DATA SETS. FLUORESCENCE-BASED IDENTIFICATION WORKED WELL WITH OAT LEAVES, PRODUCING 92.2 % OF CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED PIXELS, WHEREAS THE TEXTURE-BASED METHOD OFTEN MIS-IDENTIFIED THE CENTRAL VEIN OF A TAROF LEAF AS OAT, IDENTIFYING CORRECTLY ONLY 66.5 % OF OAT PIXELS. WITH TAROF THAT SHOWS A CLEAR DICOT-TYPE TEXTURE, THE TEXTURE METHOD WAS SLIGHTLY BETTER (96.4 % CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED PIXELS) THAN THE FLUORESCENCE METHOD (94.6 %).

HOWEVER, APPLICATIONS THAT CAN GEOLOCATE INDIVIDUAL TREES AND IDENTIFY THEIR SPECIES IN HETEROGENEOUS FORESTS ON A LARGE SCALE ARE LACKING. HERE, WE ASSESSED THE POTENTIAL OF THE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK ALGORITHM, FASTER R-CNN, WHICH IS AN EFFICIENT END-TO-END OBJECT DETECTION APPROACH, COMBINED WITH OPEN-SOURCE AERIAL RGB IMAGERY FOR THE IDENTIFICATION AND GEOLOCATION OF TREE SPECIES IN THE UPPER CANOPY LAYER OF HETEROGENEOUS TEMPERATE FORESTS. WE STUDIED FOUR TREE SPECIES, I.E., NORWAY SPRUCE (PICEA ABIES (L.) H. KARST.), SILVER FIR (ABIES ALBA MILL.), SCOTS PINE (PINUS SYLVESTRIS L.), AND EUROPEAN BEECH (FAGUS SYLVATICA L.), GROWING IN HETEROGENEOUS TEMPERATE FORESTS. TO FULLY EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL OF THE APPROACH FOR TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION, WE TRAINED SINGLE-SPECIES AND MULTI-SPECIES MODELS. FOR THE SINGLE-SPECIES MODELS, THE AVERAGE DETECTION ACCURACY (F1 SCORE) WAS 0.76. PICEA ABIES WAS DETECTED WITH THE HIGHEST ACCURACY, WITH AN AVERAGE F1 OF 0.86, FOLLOWED BY A. ALBA (F1 = 0.84), F. SYLVATICA (F1 = 0.75), AND PINUS SYLVESTRIS (F1 = 0.59). DETECTION ACCURACY INCREASED IN MULTI-SPECIES MODELS FOR PINUS SYLVESTRIS (F1 = 0.92), WHILE IT REMAINED THE SAME OR DECREASED SLIGHTLY FOR THE OTHER SPECIES. MODEL PERFORMANCE WAS MORE INFLUENCED BY SITE CONDITIONS, SUCH AS FOREST STAND STRUCTURE, AND LESS BY ILLUMINATION. MOREOVER, THE MISIDENTIFICATION OF TREE SPECIES DECREASED AS THE NUMBER OF SPECIES INCLUDED IN THE MODELS INCREASED. IN CONCLUSION, THE PRESENTED METHOD CAN ACCURATELY MAP THE LOCATION OF FOUR INDIVIDUAL TREE SPECIES IN HETEROGENEOUS FORESTS AND MAY SERVE AS A BASIS FOR FUTURE INVENTORIES AND TARGETED MANAGEMENT ACTIONS TO SUPPORT MORE RESILIENT FORESTS.

IN CONTRAST, DEEP LEARNING BASED APPROACHES ARE MORE GENERALIZABLE, BUT THE EXTRACTED FEATURES ARE NOT INTERPRETED; MOREOVER, THE METHODS CAN HARDLY BE APPLIED TO LIMITED SAMPLE SETS. IN THIS STUDY, TO FURTHER IMPROVE ITS IDENTIFICATION, TYPICAL SPECTRAL AND TEXTURE IMAGE FEATURES WERE WEIGHTED TO ASSIST DEEP LEARNING MODELS FOR ITS IDENTIFICATION. TO VALIDATE THE HYBRID MODELS, TWO EXPERIMENTS WERE CONDUCTED; ONE ON THE DENSE FORESTS OF THE HUANGSHAN MOUNTAINS, ANHUI PROVINCE AND ONE ON THE GAOFENG FOREST FARM, GUANGXI PROVINCE, CHINA. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT WITH THE ADDITION OF IMAGE FEATURES, DIFFERENT DEEP LEARNING ITS IDENTIFICATION MODELS, SUCH AS DENSENET, ALEXNET, U-NET, AND LENET, WITH DIFFERENT LIMITED SAMPLE SIZES (480, 420, 360), WERE ALL ENHANCED IN BOTH STUDY AREAS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ACCURACY OF DENSENET MODEL WITH A SAMPLE SIZE OF 480 WERE IMPROVED TO 87.67% FROM 85.41% IN HUANGSHAN.

FURTHER, P-TAREF WAS RUN OVER THE EXPERIMENTALLY VALIDATED MIRNA TARGETS FROM SPECIES LIKE ARABIDOPSIS, MEDICAGO, RICE AND TOMATO, AND DETECTED THEM ACCURATELY, SUGGESTING GROSS USABILITY OF P-TAREF FOR PLANT SPECIES. USING P-TAREF, TARGET IDENTIFICATION WAS DONE FOR THE COMPLETE RICE TRANSCRIPTOME, SUPPORTED BY EXPRESSION AND DEGRADOME BASED DATA. MIR156 WAS FOUND AS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE RICE REGULATORY SYSTEM, WHERE CONTROL OF GENES ASSOCIATED WITH GROWTH AND TRANSCRIPTION LOOKED PREDOMINANT. THE ENTIRE METHODOLOGY HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN A MULTI-THREADED PARALLEL ARCHITECTURE IN JAVA, TO ENABLE FAST PROCESSING FOR WEB-SERVER VERSION AS WELL AS STANDALONE VERSION. THIS ALSO MAKES IT TO RUN EVEN ON A SIMPLE DESKTOP COMPUTER IN CONCURRENT MODE. IT ALSO PROVIDES A FACILITY TO GATHER EXPERIMENTAL SUPPORT FOR PREDICTIONS MADE, THROUGH ON THE SPOT EXPRESSION DATA ANALYSIS, IN ITS WEB-SERVER VERSION.CONCLUSION: A MACHINE LEARNING MULTIVARIATE FEATURE TOOL HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN PARALLEL AND LOCALLY INSTALLABLE FORM, FOR PLANT MIRNA TARGET IDENTIFICATION. THE PERFORMANCE WAS ASSESSED AND COMPARED THROUGH COMPREHENSIVE TESTING AND BENCHMARKING, SUGGESTING A RELIABLE PERFORMANCE AND GROSS USABILITY FOR TRANSCRIPTOME WIDE PLANT MIRNA TARGET IDENTIFICATION.

"LI Y;CHAI G;WANG Y;LEI L;ZHANG X";ACE RCNN AN ATTENTION COMPLEMENTARY AND EDGE DETECTIONBASED INSTANCE SEGMENTATION ALGORITHM FOR INDIVIDUAL TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION USING UAV RGB IMAGES AND LIDAR DATA;ACCURATE AND AUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION OF TREE SPECIES INFORMATION AT THE INDIVIDUAL TREE SCALE IS OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE FOR FINEâ€SCALE INVESTIGATION AND MANAGEMENT OF FOREST RESOURCES AND SCIENTIFIC ASSESSMENT OF FOREST ECOSYSTEMS. DESPITE THE FACT THAT NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE BEEN CON-DUCTED ON THE DELINEATION OF INDIVIDUAL TREE CROWN AND SPECIES CLASSIFICATION USING DRONE HIGHâ€RES-OLUTION RED, GREEN AND BLUE (RGB) IMAGES, AND LIGHT DETECTION AND RANGING (LIDAR) DATA, PERFORMING THE ABOVE TASKS SIMULTANEOUSLY HAS RARELY BEEN EXPLORED, ESPECIALLY IN COMPLEX FOREST ENVIRON-MENTS. IN THIS STUDY, WE IMPROVE UPON THE STATE OF THE MASK REGIONâ€BASED CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORK (MASK Râ€CNN) WITH OUR PROPOSED ATTENTION COMPLEMENTARY NETWORK (ACNET) AND EDGE DETECTION Râ€CNN (ACE Râ€CNN) FOR INDIVIDUAL TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION IN HIGHâ€DENSITY AND COMPLEX FOREST ENVIRONMENTS. FIRST, WE PROPOSE ACNET AS THE FEATURE EXTRACTION BACKBONE NETWORK TO FUSE THE WEIGHTED FEATURES EXTRACTED FROM RGB IMAGES AND CANOPY HEIGHT MODEL (CHM) DATA THROUGH AN ATTENTION COMPLEMENTARY MODULE, WHICH IS ABLE TO SELECTIVELY FUSE WEIGHTED FEATURES EXTRACTED FROM RGB AND CHM DATA AT DIFFERENT SCALES, AND ENABLES THE NETWORK TO FOCUS ON MORE EFFECTIVE INFORMATION. SECOND, EDGE LOSS IS ADDED TO THE LOSS FUNCTION TO IMPROVE THE EDGE ACCURACY OF THE SEGMENTATION, WHICH IS CALCULATED THROUGH THE EDGE DETECTION FILTER INTRODUCED IN THE MASK BRANCH OF MASK Râ€CNN. WE DEMONSTRATE THE PERFORMANCE OF ACE Râ€CNN FOR INDIVIDUAL TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION IN THREE EXPERIMENTAL AREAS OF DIFFERENT TREE SPECIES IN SOUTHERN CHINA WITH PRECISION (P), RECALL (R), F1â€SCORE, AND AVERAGE PRECISION (AP) ABOVE 0.9. OUR PROPOSED ACNETâ€“THE BACKBONE NETWORK FOR FEATURE EXTRACTIONâ€“HAS BETTER PERFORMANCE IN INDIVIDUAL TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION COMPARED WITH THE RESNET50â€FPN (FEATURE PYRAMID NETWORK). THE ADDITION OF THE EDGE LOSS OBTAINED BY THE SOBEL FILTER FURTHER IMPROVES THE IDENTIFICATION ACCURACY OF INDIVIDUAL TREE SPECIES AND ACCEL-ERATES THE CONVERGENCE SPEED OF THE MODEL TRAINING. THIS WORK DEMONSTRATES THE IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OF ACE Râ€CNN FOR INDIVIDUAL TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION AND PROVIDES A NEW SOLUTION FOR TREEâ€LEVEL SPECIES IDENTIFICATION IN COMPLEX FOREST ENVIRONMENTS, WHICH CAN SUPPORT CARBON STOCK ESTIMATION AND BIODIVERSITY ASSESSMENT.

IN ADDITION, AN OPEN DATABASE OF CROP DISEASES WAS ALSO USED, SUCH AS THE PADDY CROP DATASET. THE PROPOSED PLANT AND CROP DISEASE CLASSIFICATION METHOD DEMONSTRATED A 98.55% ACCURACY FOR THE THERMAL PLANT IMAGE DATASET AND A 90.04% ACCURACY FOR THE PADDY CROP DATASET, BOTH OF WHICH OUTPERFORMED OTHER EXISTING METHODS. Â© 2022 THE AUTHOR(S) QUANTUM-BASED CLASSIFIERS AND ARCHITECTURE ARE GAINING LOTS OF ATTENTION IN IMAGE REPRESENTATION AND CRYPTOGRAPHY. THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM APPLIES A QUANTUM CLASSIFIER TO A COMPUTER VISION SYSTEM FOR LEAF RECOGNITION WHICH CAN BE APPLIED TO A QUANTUM COMPUTER. IMAGES FROM TEN SPECIES OF LEAVES WHICH ARE CATEGORISED INTO TWO GROUPS, NAMELY SIMPLE AND PALMATELY, ARE RECOGNISED USING A QUANTUM CLASSIFIER. THE PIXELS OF IMAGES ARE TRANSFORMED TO QUBIT STATES USING QUANTUM FOURIER TRANSFORM (QFT) AND HADAMARD GATES. THE PROFILE AND STRUCTURAL FEATURES ARE EXTRACTED BY APPLYING 1D-CONVOLUTION AND CONTROLLED NOT (CNOT) GATES. A QUANTUM NEAREST NEIGHBOUR SEARCH CLASSIFIER IS USED TO FIND THE CLOSEST MATCHING LEAF BASED ON PROBABILITY. THE RESULTS FOR DIFFERENT LEVELS OF IMAGE PROCESSING ARE EVALUATED AND COMPARED WITH THE NEAREST NEIGHBOUR CLASSIFIER. THE RECOGNITION RATE OF THE QUANTUM CLASSIFIER FOR THE BEST LEVEL OF IMAGE PROCESSING IS 97.33%. THE RECOGNITION RATE OF THE CLASSIFIER IS BETTER THAN THE NEAREST NEIGHBOUR CLASSIFIER AND ALSO HAS A LOW COMPUTATION TIME. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT: [FIGURE NOT AVAILABLE: SEE FULLTEXT.].

"BATCHULUUN G;NAM S;PARK C;PARK K";SUPERRESOLUTION RECONSTRUCTIONBASED PLANT IMAGE CLASSIFICATION USING THERMAL AND VISIBLELIGHT IMAGES;FEW STUDIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED ON THERMAL PLANT IMAGES. THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY IN EXTRACTING AND ANALYZING VARIOUS COLOR-RELATED PATTERNS AND FEATURES FROM THE PLANT IMAGE OBTAINED USING A THERMAL CAMERA, WHICH DOES NOT PROVIDE COLOR INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, THE THERMAL CAMERA IS SENSITIVE TO THE SURROUNDING TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY. HOWEVER, THE THERMAL CAMERA ENABLES THE EXTRACTION OF INVISIBLE PATTERNS IN THE PLANT BY PROVIDING EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL HEAT INFORMATION. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY PROPOSED A NOVEL PLANT CLASSIFICATION METHOD BASED ON BOTH THE THERMAL AND VISIBLE-LIGHT PLANT IMAGES TO EXPLOIT THE STRENGTHS OF BOTH TYPES OF CAMERAS. TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS STUDY IS THE FIRST TO PERFORM SUPER-RESOLUTION RECONSTRUCTION USING VISIBLE-LIGHT AND THERMAL PLANT IMAGES. FURTHERMORE, A METHOD TO IMPROVE THE CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE THROUGH GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORK (GAN)-BASED SUPER-RESOLUTION RECONSTRUCTION WAS PROPOSED.

ALTHOUGH THEY RETURN SATISFACTORY RESULTS IN MOST TASKS, SOME CHALLENGES RELATED TO HYPERSPECTRAL DATA REMAIN, LIKE THE CURSE OF DATA DIMENSIONALITY. IN FORESTED AREAS, ANOTHER COMMON PROBLEM IS THE HIGHLY-DENSE DISTRIBUTION OF TREES. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL DEEP LEARNING APPROACH FOR HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGERY TO IDENTIFY SINGLE-TREE SPECIES IN HIGHLY-DENSE AREAS. WE EVALUATED IMAGES WITH 25 SPECTRAL BANDS RANGING FROM 506 TO 820 NM TAKEN OVER A SEMIDECIDUOUS FOREST OF THE BRAZILIAN ATLANTIC BIOME. WE INCLUDED IN OUR NETWORK'S ARCHITECTURE A BAND COMBINATION SELECTION PHASE. THIS PHASE LEARNS FROM MULTIPLE COMBINATIONS BETWEEN BANDS WHICH CONTRIBUTED THE MOST FOR THE TREE IDENTIFICATION TASK. THIS IS FOLLOWED BY A FEATURE MAP EXTRACTION AND A MULTI-STAGE MODEL REFINEMENT OF THE CONFIDENCE MAP TO PRODUCE ACCURATE RESULTS OF A HIGHLY-DENSE TARGET. OUR METHOD RETURNED AN F-MEASURE, PRECISION AND RECALL VALUES OF 0.959, 0.973, AND 0.945, RESPECTIVELY. THE RESULTS WERE SUPERIOR WHEN COMPARED WITH A PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS (PCA) APPROACH. COMPARED TO OTHER LEARNING METHODS, OURS ESTIMATE A COMBINATION OF HYPERSPECTRAL BANDS THAT MOST CONTRIBUTE TO THE MENTIONED TASK WITHIN THE NETWORK'S ARCHITECTURE. WITH THIS, THE PROPOSED METHOD ACHIEVED STATE-OF-THE-ART PERFORMANCE FOR DETECTING AND GEOLOCATING INDIVIDUAL TREE-SPECIES IN UAV-BASED HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGES IN A COMPLEX FOREST.

RECENTLY, COMBINATION OF UAV RGB IMAGE AND DEEP LEARNING HAS SHOWN HIGH PERFORMANCE FOR TREE IDENTIFICATION IN LIMITED CONDITIONS. IN THIS STUDY, WE EVALUATED THE PRACTICALITY AND ROBUSTNESS OF THE TREE IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM USING UAVS AND DEEP LEARNING. WE SAMPLED TRAINING AND TEST DATA FROM THREE SITES IN TEMPERATE FORESTS IN JAPAN. THE OBJECTIVE TREE SPECIES RANGED ACROSS 56 SPECIES, INCLUDING DEAD TREES AND GAPS. WHEN WE EVALUATED THE MODEL PERFORMANCE ON THE DATASET OBTAINED FROM THE SAME TIME AND SAME TREE CROWNS AS THE TRAINING DATASET, IT YIELDED A KAPPA SCORE OF 0.97, AND 0.72, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE PERFORMANCE ON THE DATASET OBTAINED FROM THE SAME TIME BUT WITH DIFFERENT TREE CROWNS. WHEN WE EVALUATED THE DATASET OBTAINED FROM DIFFERENT TIMES AND SITES FROM THE TRAINING DATASET, WHICH IS THE SAME CONDITION AS THE PRACTICAL ONE, THE KAPPA SCORES DECREASED TO 0.47. THOUGH CONIFEROUS TREES AND REPRESENTATIVE SPECIES OF STANDS SHOWED A CERTAIN STABLE PERFORMANCE REGARDING IDENTIFICATION, SOME MISCLASSIFICATIONS OCCURRED BETWEEN: (1) TREES THAT BELONG TO PHYLOGENETICALLY CLOSE SPECIES, (2) TREE SPECIES WITH SIMILAR LEAF SHAPES, AND (3) TREE SPECIES THAT PREFER THE SAME ENVI-RONMENT. FURTHERMORE, TREE TYPES SUCH AS CONIFEROUS AND BROADLEAVED OR EVERGREEN AND DECIDUOUS DO NOT ALWAYS GUARANTEE COMMON FEATURES BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT TREES BELONGING TO THE TREE TYPE.

THE IMAGE PROCESSING, FEATURE ENGINEERING AND MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES WERE DISCUSSED WHEN DEVELOPING AN OPTIMAL CLASSIFICATION MODEL FOR THE THREE KINDS OF WEEDS AND MAIZE. A TOTAL SET OF 185 SPECTRAL FEATURES INCLUDING REFLECTANCE AND VEGETATION INDEX FEATURES WAS CONSTRUCTED. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS WAS USED TO REDUCE THE REDUNDANCY OF THE CONSTRUCTED FEATURES, AND THE FIRST 5 PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS, EXPLAINING OVER 95% VARIANCE RATIO, WERE KEPT FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS. FURTHERMORE, RANDOM FORESTS AS ONE OF MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES WERE BUILT FOR DEVELOPING THE CLASSIFIER WITH THREE DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF FEATURES. ACCURACY-ORIENTED FEATURE REDUCTION WAS PERFORMED WHEN CHOOSING THE OPTIMAL NUMBER OF FEATURES FOR BUILDING THE CLASSIFICATION MODEL. MOREOVER, HYPERPARAMETER TUNING WAS EXPLORED FOR THE OPTIMAL SELECTION OF RANDOM FOREST MODEL. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE OPTIMAL RANDOM FOREST MODEL WITH 30 IMPORTANT SPECTRAL FEATURES CAN ACHIEVE A MEAN CORRECT CLASSIFICATION RATE OF 1.0, 0.789, 0.691 AND 0.752 FOR ZEA MAYS, CONVOLVULUS ARVENSIS, RUMEX AND CIRSIUM ARVENSE, RESPECTIVELY.

THIS PAPER REPORTS A STUDY ON DEVELOPING A HYPERSPECTRAL PLANT SENSING APPROACH TO EXPLORE THE SPECTRAL FEATURES OF GLYPHOSATE-RESISTANT (GR) AND GLYPHOSATE-SENSITIVE (GS) PLANTS TO EVALUATE THIS APPROACH USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN GR AND GS PLANTS. RESULTS: ON AVERAGE, GR PLANTS HAVE HIGHER SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE COMPARED WITH GS PLANTS. THE SENSITIVE SPECTRAL BANDS WERE OPTIMALLY SELECTED USING THE SUCCESSIVE PROJECTIONS ALGORITHM RESPECTIVELY WRAPPED WITH THE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS OF K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS (KNN), RANDOM FOREST (RF), AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) WITH FISHER LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS (FLDA) TO CLASSIFY BETWEEN GS AND GS PLANTS. AT 3 WEEKS AFTER TRANSPLANTING (WAT) KNN AND SVM COULD NOT ACCEPTABLY CLASSIFY THE GR AND GS PLANTS BUT THEY IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH THE STAGES TO HAVE THEIR OVERALL ACCURACIES REACHING 73% AND 77%, RESPECTIVELY, AT 5 WAT. RF AND FLDA HAD A BETTER ABILITY TO CLASSIFY THE PLANTS AT 3 WAT BUT RF WAS LOW IN ACCURACY AT 2 WAT WHILE FLDA DROPPED ACCURACY TO 50% AT 4 WAT FROM 57% AT 3 WAT AND RAISED IT TO 73% AT 5 WAT. CONCLUSIONS: PREVIOUS STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED DEVELOPING THE HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGING APPROACH TO DIFFERENTIATE GR PALMER AMARANTH FROM GS PALMER AMARANTH AND GR ITALIAN RYEGRASS FROM GS ITALIAN RYEGRASS WITH CLASSIFICATION ACCURACIES OF 90% AND 80%, RESPECTIVELY. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT THE HYPERSPECTRAL PLANT SENSING APPROACH COULD BE DEVELOPED TO DIFFERENTIATE GR JOHNSONGRASS FROM GLYPHOSATE-SENSITIVE GS JOHNSONGRASS WITH THE HIGHEST CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY OF 77%. THE COMPARISON WITH OUR PREVIOUS STUDIES INDICATED THAT THE SIMILAR HYPERSPECTRAL APPROACH COULD BE USED AND TRANSFERRED FROM CLASSIFICATION ACROSS DIFFERENT GR AND GS WEED BIOTYPES, SUCH AS PALMER AMARANTH, ITALIAN RYEGRASS AND JOHNSONGRASS, SO IT IS HIGHLY POSSIBLE FOR CLASSIFICATION OF MORE OTHER GR AND GS WEED BIOTYPES AS WELL.

THE INSTRUMENT MEASURES ELECTRICAL-RESISTANCE CHANGES GENERATED BY ADSORPTION OF VOLATILES TO THE SURFACE OF ELECTROACTIVE, POLYMER-COATED SENSORS. UNIQUE DIGITAL ELECTRONIC FINGERPRINTS OF WOOD AROMAS, DERIVED FROM MULTISENSOR-RESPONSES TO DISTINCT MIXTURES OF WOOD VOLATILES, WERE OBTAINED FROM WOODS OF INDIVIDUAL TREE SPECIES. A REFERENCE LIBRARY CONTAINING AROMA SIGNATURE PATTERNS FOR 23 TREE SPECIES WAS CONSTRUCTED FOR IDENTIFICATIONS OF UNKNOWN SAMPLES USING PATTERN-RECOGNITION ALGORITHMS. THE 32-SENSOR ARRAY USED WITH AN AROMASCAN A32S INSTRUMENT WAS SENSITIVE TO A WIDE DIVERSITY OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS AND PRODUCED OUTPUTS OF DISTINCT ELECTRONIC AROMA SIGNATURE PATTERNS IN RESPONSE TO WOOD VOLATILES THAT EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFIED UNKNOWN SAMPLES FROM INDIVIDUAL TREE SPECIES INCLUDED IN THE REFERENCE LIBRARY. SOME POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS OF CPA METHODS FOR RESEARCH IN ECOLOGY, FORESTRY, PLANT TAXONOMY, AND RELATED DISCIPLINES WERE IDENTIFIED WITH SOME SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS. OTHER APPLICATIONS OF THIS TECHNOLOGY WERE DISCOVERED FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF FORESTED STANDS AND ECOSYSTEMS BASED ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF ROLES THAT WOOD-INHABITING ORGANISMS PLAY IN STAND DYNAMICS AND LONG-TERM ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS.

TO MAKE THE VISUAL RECOGNITION MODULE CONTINUE TO WORK PROPERLY, IN THIS PAPER, THE BETTER CYCLE GAN (GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS) MODEL IS PROPOSED TO DEAL WITH NOISE BASED ON THREE COMMON NOISES, AND FINALLY, THROUGH A LOT OF EXPERIMENTS, IT IS PROVED THAT THE IMPROVEMENT HAS SOME SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE VISION RECOGNITION MODULE, WHICH EXTENDS THE USE OF THE VISION RECOGNITION MODULE AND MAKES THE INTELLIGENT PLANT CULTIVATION ROBOT AVOID THE INTERFERENCE OF NOISE.

FOR REMOTE PLANT MONITORING, CONTROL, AND MAINTENANCE, WE SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF PLANT CLASSIFICATION. DUE TO THE INHERENT COMMUNICATION LIMITATIONS BETWEEN ANTARCTICA AND EUROPE, WE FIRST PROPOSE THE IMAGE COMPRESSION MECHANISM FOR THE DATA COLLECTION. WE SHOW THAT WE CAN COMPRESS THE IMAGES, ON AVERAGE, 7.2 TIMES FOR EFFICIENT TRANSMISSION OVER THE WEAK CHANNEL. MOREOVER, WE PROVE THAT DECOMPRESSED IMAGES CAN BE FURTHER USED FOR COMPUTER VISION APPLICATIONS. UPON DECOMPRESSING IMAGES, WE APPLY MACHINE LEARNING FOR THE CLASSIFICATION TASK. WE ACHIEVE 92.6% ACCURACY ON AN 18-CLASSES UNBALANCED DATASET.

THERE WERE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO UTILIZE LEAVES AND FLOWERS FOR IDENTIFICATION; HOWEVER, BARK ALSO COULD BE BENEFICIAL, ESPECIALLY FOR TREES, DUE TO ITS CONSISTENCY THROUGHOUT THE SEASONS AND ITS EASY ACCESSIBILITY, EVEN IN HIGH CROWN CONDITIONS. PREVIOUS STUDIES REGARDING BARK IDENTIFICATION HAVE MOSTLY CONTRIBUTED QUANTITATIVELY TO INCREASING CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY. HOWEVER, EVER SINCE COMPUTER VISION ALGORITHMS SURPASSED THE IDENTIFICATION ABILITY OF HUMANS, AN OPEN QUESTION ARISES AS TO HOW MACHINES SUCCESSFULLY INTERPRET AND UNRAVEL THE COMPLICATED PATTERNS OF BARKS. HERE, WE TRAINED TWO CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS) WITH DISTINCT ARCHITECTURES USING A LARGE-SCALE BARK IMAGE DATASET AND APPLIED CLASS ACTIVATION MAPPING (CAM) AGGREGATION TO INVESTIGATE DIAGNOSTIC KEYS FOR IDENTIFYING EACH SPECIES. CNNS COULD IDENTIFY THE BARKS OF 42 SPECIES WITH > 90% ACCURACY, AND THE OVERALL ACCURACIES SHOWED A SMALL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO MODELS. DIAGNOSTIC KEYS MATCHED WITH SALIENT SHAPES, WHICH WERE ALSO EASILY RECOGNIZED BY HUMAN EYES, AND WERE TYPIFIED AS BLISTERS, HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL STRIPES, LENTICELS OF VARIOUS SHAPES, AND VERTICAL CREVICES AND CLEFTS. THE TWO MODELS EXHIBITED DISPARATE QUALITY IN THE DIAGNOSTIC FEATURES: THE OLD AND LESS COMPLEX MODEL SHOWED MORE GENERAL AND WELL-MATCHING PATTERNS, WHILE THE BETTER-PERFORMING MODEL WITH MUCH DEEPER LAYERS INDICATED LOCAL PATTERNS LESS RELEVANT TO BARKS. CNNS WERE ALSO CAPABLE OF PREDICTING UNTRAINED SPECIES BY 41.98% AND 48.67% WITHIN THE CORRECT GENUS AND FAMILY, RESPECTIVELY.

A PREREQUISITE FOR SUCH SYSTEMS IS A ROBUST PLANT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM THAT CAN IDENTIFY CROPS AND WEEDS IN VARIOUS AGRICULTURAL FIELDS. MOST VISION-BASED SYSTEMS TRAIN CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS) ON A GIVEN DATASET, I.E., THE SOURCE DOMAIN, TO PERFORM SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION OF IMAGES. HOWEVER, DEPLOYING THESE MODELS ON UNSEEN FIELDS, I.E., IN THE TARGET DOMAIN, OFTEN SHOWS A LOW GENERALIZATION CAPABILITY. ENHANCING THE GENERALIZATION CAPABILITY OF CNNS IS CRITICAL TO INCREASING THEIR PERFORMANCE ON TARGET DOMAINS WITH DIFFERENT OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS. IN THIS LETTER, WE PRESENT A DOMAIN GENERALIZED SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION APPROACH FOR ROBUST CROP AND WEED DETECTION BY EFFECTIVELY EXTENDING AND DIVERSIFYING THE SOURCE DOMAIN TO ACHIEVE HIGH PERFORMANCE ACROSS DIFFERENT AGRICULTURAL FIELD CONDITIONS. WE PROPOSE TO LEVERAGE UNLABELED IMAGES CAPTURED FROM VARIOUS AGRICULTURAL FIELDS DURING TRAINING IN A TWO-STEP FRAMEWORK. FIRST, WE SUGGEST A METHOD TO AUTOMATICALLY COMPUTE SPARSE ANNOTATIONS AND USE THEM TO PRESENT THE MODEL MORE PLANT VARIETIES AND GROWTH STAGES TO ENHANCE ITS GENERALIZATION CAPABILITY.

ROBOTS THAT CAN PERFORM TARGETED WEED CONTROL OFFER THE POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS GOAL, FOR EXAMPLE, THROUGH SPECIALIZED WEEDING ACTIONS SUCH AS SELECTIVE SPRAYING OR MECHANICAL WEED REMOVAL. A PREREQUISITE OF SUCH SYSTEMS IS A RELIABLE AND ROBUST PLANT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM THAT IS ABLE TO DISTINGUISH CROP AND WEED IN THE FIELD. A MAJOR CHALLENGE IN THIS CONTEXT IS THE FACT THAT DIFFERENT FIELDS SHOW A LARGE VARIABILITY. THUS, CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS HAVE TO ROBUSTLY COPE WITH SUBSTANTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES WITH RESPECT TO WEED PRESSURE AND WEED TYPES, GROWTH STAGES OF THE CROP, VISUAL APPEARANCE, AND SOIL CONDITIONS. IN THIS LETTER, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL CROP-WEED CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM THAT RELIES ON A FULLY CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORK WITH AN ENCODER-DECODER STRUCTURE AND INCORPORATES SPATIAL INFORMATION BY CONSIDERING IMAGE SEQUENCES. EXPLOITING THE CROP ARRANGEMENT INFORMATION THAT IS OBSERVABLE FROM THE IMAGE SEQUENCES ENABLES OUR SYSTEM TO ROBUSTLY ESTIMATE A PIXEL-WISE LABELING OF THE IMAGES INTO CROP AND WEED, I.E., A SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION.

IN THE CASE OF THE RICE-MAGNAPORTHE ORYZAE PATHOSYSTEM, FEWER PAMPS AND THEIR PATTERN RECOGNITION RECEPTORS (PRRS) HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED. RECENTLY, A M. ORYZAE SNODPROT1 HOMOLOG PROTEIN (MSP1) HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED THAT FUNCTIONS AS PAMP AND TRIGGERING THE PTI RESPONSES IN RICE. HOWEVER, THE MOLECULAR MECHANISM UNDERLYING MSP1-INDUCED PTI IS CURRENTLY ELUSIVE. THEREFORE, WE GENERATED MSP1 OVEREXPRESSED TRANSGENIC LINES OF RICE, AND A TANDEM MASS TAG (TMT)-BASED QUANTITATIVE MEMBRANE PROTEOMIC ANALYSIS WAS EMPLOYED TO DECIPHER THE POTENTIAL MSP1-INDUCED SIGNALING IN RICE USING TOTAL CYTOSOLIC AS WELL AS MEMBRANE PROTEIN FRACTIONS. THIS APPROACH LED TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF 8033 PROTEINS OF WHICH 1826 WERE DIFFERENTIALLY MODULATED IN RESPONSE TO OVEREXPRESSION OF MSP1 AND/OR EXOGENOUS JASMONIC ACID TREATMENT. OF THESE, 20 PLASMA MEMBRANE-LOCALIZED RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASES (RLKS) SHOWED INCREASED ABUNDANCE IN MSP1 OVEREXPRESSION LINES. MOREOVER, ACTIVATION OF PROTEINS RELATED TO THE PROTEIN DEGRADATION AND MODIFICATION, CALCIUM SIGNALING, REDOX, AND MAPK SIGNALING WAS OBSERVED IN TRANSGENIC LINES EXPRESSING MSP1 IN THE APOPLAST.

"CHAKI J;PAREKH R;BHATTACHARYA S";PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION USING TEXTURE AND SHAPE FEATURES WITH NEURAL CLASSIFIERS;ABSTRACT THIS PAPER PROPOSES A NOVEL METHODOLOGY OF CHARACTERIZING AND RECOGNIZING PLANT LEAVES USING A COMBINATION OF TEXTURE AND SHAPE FEATURES. TEXTURE OF THE LEAF IS MODELED USING GABOR FILTER AND GRAY LEVEL CO-OCCURRENCE MATRIX (GLCM) WHILE SHAPE OF THE LEAF IS CAPTURED USING A SET OF CURVELET TRANSFORM COEFFICIENTS TOGETHER WITH INVARIANT MOMENTS. SINCE THESE FEATURES ARE IN GENERAL SENSITIVE TO THE ORIENTATION AND SCALING OF THE LEAF IMAGE, A PRE-PROCESSING STAGE PRIOR TO FEATURE EXTRACTION IS APPLIED TO MAKE CORRECTIONS FOR VARYING TRANSLATION, ROTATION AND SCALING FACTORS. EFFICACY OF THE PROPOSED METHODS IS STUDIED BY USING TWO NEURAL CLASSIFIERS: A NEURO-FUZZY CONTROLLER (NFC) AND A FEED-FORWARD BACK-PROPAGATION MULTI-LAYERED PERCEPTRON (MLP) TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN 31 CLASSES OF LEAVES. THE FEATURES HAVE BEEN APPLIED INDIVIDUALLY AS WELL AS IN COMBINATION TO INVESTIGATE HOW RECOGNITION ACCURACIES CAN BE IMPROVED.

"CHUNG Y;CHOU C;LI C";CENTRAL ATTENTION AND A DUAL PATH CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK IN REALWORLD TREE SPECIES RECOGNITION;IDENTIFYING PLANTS IS NOT ONLY THE JOB OF PROFESSIONALS, BUT ALSO USEFUL OR ESSENTIAL FOR THE PLANT LOVER AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. ALTHOUGH DEEP LEARNING APPROACHES FOR PLANT RECOGNITION ARE PROMISING, DRIVEN BY THE SUCCESS OF CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNN), THEIR PERFORMANCES ARE STILL FAR FROM THE REQUIREMENTS OF AN IN-FIELD SCENARIO. FIRST, WE PROPOSE A CENTRAL ATTENTION CONCEPT THAT HELPS FOCUS ON THE TARGET INSTEAD OF BACKGROUNDS IN THE IMAGE FOR TREE SPECIES RECOGNITION. IT COULD PREVENT MODEL TRAINING FROM CONFUSED VISION BY ESTABLISHING A DUAL PATH CNN DEEP LEARNING FRAMEWORK, IN WHICH THE CENTRAL ATTENTION MODEL COMBINED WITH THE CNN MODEL BASED ON INCEP-TIONV3 WERE EMPLOYED TO AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACT THE FEATURES. THESE TWO MODELS WERE THEN LEARNED TOGETHER WITH A SHARED CLASSIFICATION LAYER. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PROPOSED APPROACH WHICH OUTPERFORMED EACH UNI-PATH ALONE, AND EXISTING METHODS IN THE WHOLE PLANT RECOGNITION SYSTEM. ADDITIONALLY, WE CREATED OUR OWN TREE IMAGE DATABASE WHERE EACH PHOTO CONTAINED A WEALTH OF INFORMATION ON THE ENTIRE TREE INSTEAD OF AN INDIVIDUAL PLANT ORGAN. LASTLY, WE DEVELOPED A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM OF AN ONLINE/OFFLINE AVAILABLE TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION WORKING ON A CONSUMER MOBILE PLATFORM THAT CAN IDENTIFY THE TREE SPECIES NOT ONLY BY IMAGE RECOGNITION, BUT ALSO DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION IN REAL-TIME REMOTELY.

"ZHU X;ZHU M;REN H";METHOD OF PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION BASED ON IMPROVED DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK;THE IDENTIFICATION OF PLANT SPECIES MAINLY DEPENDS ON THE RECOGNITION OF PLANT LEAF CHARACTERISTICS. HOWEVER, MOST RECOGNITION SYSTEMS SHOW THE WEAK PERFORMANCE ON DETECTING SMALL OBJECTS LIKE PLANT LEAVES IN THE COMPLICATED BACKGROUND. IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE RECOGNITION ABILITY OF PLANT LEAVES IN THE COMPLEX ENVIRONMENT, THIS PAPER PROPOSES AN IMPROVED DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK, WHICH TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE INCEPTION V2 WITH BATCH NORMALIZATION (BN) INSTEAD OF CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL LAYERS IN THE FASTER REGION CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (FASTER RCNN) OFFERING MULTISCALE IMAGE FEATURES TO THE REGION PROPOSAL NETWORK (RPN). IN ADDITION, THE ORIGINAL IMAGES FIRST ARE CUT INTO THE SPECIFIED SIZE ACCORDING TO THE NUMERICAL ORDER, AND THE SEGMENTED IMAGES ARE LOADED INTO THE PROPOSED NETWORK SEQUENTIALLY. AFTER THE PRECISE CLASSIFICATION THROUGH SOFTMAX AND BOUNDING BOX REGRESSOR, THE SEGMENTED IMAGES WITH IDENTIFICATION LABELS ARE SPLICED TOGETHER AS FINAL OUTPUT IMAGES.

THESE LOSSES HAVE POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR ENGAGEMENT WITH CONSERVATION ISSUES, GAINING HUMAN WELLBEING BENEFITS FROM BIODIVERSITY (SUCH AS THOSE RESULTING FROM NATURE-BASED RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES), AND EARLY WARNING OF THE SPREAD OF PROBLEMATIC SPECIES. HOWEVER, UNDERSTANDING OF THE PREVAILING LEVEL OF SPECIES IDENTIFICATION SKILLS, AND OF ITS KEY DRIVERS, REMAINS POOR. HERE, WE EXPLORE SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS INFLUENCING PLANT IDENTIFICATION KNOWLEDGE AND ABILITY TO CLASSIFY PLANTS AS NATIVE OR NON-NATIVE, EMPLOYING A NOVEL METHOD OF USING REAL PHYSICAL PLANTS, RATHER THAN PHOTOGRAPHS OR ILLUSTRATIONS. WE CONDUCTED FACE-TO-FACE SURVEYS AT THREE DIFFERENT SITES CHOSEN TO CAPTURE RESPONDENTS WITH A RANGE OF SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC CIRCUMSTANCES, IN CORNWALL, UK. WE FOUND THAT SURVEY PARTICIPANTS CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED C.60% OF COMMON PLANT SPECIES, WERE SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE AT NAMING NON-NATIVE THAN NATIVE PLANTS, AND THAT LESS THAN 20% OF PEOPLE RECOGNISED JAPANESE KNOTWEED FALLOPIA JAPONICA, WHICH IS A WIDESPREAD HIGH PROFILE INVASIVE NON-NATIVE IN THE STUDY REGION. SUCCESS AT NAMING PLANTS WAS HIGHER IF PARTICIPANTS WERE FEMALE, A MEMBER OF AT LEAST ONE ENVIRONMENTAL, CONSERVATION OR GARDENING ORGANISATION, IN AN OLDER AGE GROUP (THAN THE BASE CATEGORY OF 18-29 YEARS), OR A RESIDENT (RATHER THAN VISITOR) OF THE STUDY AREA. UNDERSTANDING PATTERNS OF VARIATION IN PLANT IDENTIFICATION KNOWLEDGE CAN INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATION AND ENGAGEMENT STRATEGIES, FOR EXAMPLE, BY TARGETING SECTORS OF SOCIETY WHERE KNOWLEDGE IS LOWEST.

"BARRÃ‰ P;STÃ–VER B;MÃœLLER K;STEINHAGE V";LEAFNET A COMPUTER VISION SYSTEM FOR AUTOMATIC PLANT SPECIES IDENTIFICATION;AIMS TAXON IDENTIFICATION IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN MANY PLANT ECOLOGICAL STUDIES. ITS EFFICIENCY AND REPRODUCIBILITY MIGHT GREATLY BENEFIT FROM PARTLY AUTOMATING THIS TASK. IMAGE-BASED IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS EXIST, BUT MOSTLY RELY ON HAND-CRAFTED ALGORITHMS TO EXTRACT SETS OF FEATURES CHOSEN A PRIORI TO IDENTIFY SPECIES OF SELECTED TAXA. IN CONSEQUENCE, SUCH SYSTEMS ARE RESTRICTED TO THESE TAXA AND ADDITIONALLY REQUIRE INVOLVING EXPERTS THAT PROVIDE TAXONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE FOR DEVELOPING SUCH CUSTOMIZED SYSTEMS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEVELOP A DEEP LEARNING SYSTEM TO LEARN DISCRIMINATIVE FEATURES FROM LEAF IMAGES ALONG WITH A CLASSIFIER FOR SPECIES IDENTIFICATION OF PLANTS. BY COMPARING OUR RESULTS WITH CUSTOMIZED SYSTEMS LIKE LEAFSNAP WE CAN SHOW THAT LEARNING THE FEATURES BY A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) CAN PROVIDE BETTER FEATURE REPRESENTATION FOR LEAF IMAGES COMPARED TO HAND-CRAFTED FEATURES. METHODS WE DEVELOPED LEAFNET, A CNN-BASED PLANT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM. FOR EVALUATION, WE UTILIZED THE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE LEAFSNAP, FLAVIA AND FOLIAGE DATASETS. RESULTS EVALUATING THE RECOGNITION ACCURACIES OF LEAFNET ON THE LEAFSNAP, FLAVIA AND FOLIAGE DATASETS REVEALS A BETTER PERFORMANCE OF LEAFNET COMPARED TO HAND-CRAFTED CUSTOMIZED SYSTEMS. CONCLUSIONS GIVEN THE OVERALL SPECIES DIVERSITY OF PLANTS, THE GOAL OF A COMPLETE AUTOMATISATION OF VISUAL PLANT SPECIES IDENTIFICATION IS UNLIKELY TO BE MET SOLELY BY CONTINUALLY GATHERING ASSEMBLIES OF CUSTOMIZED, SPECIALIZED AND HAND-CRAFTED (AND THEREFORE EXPENSIVE) IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS.

"GANGULY S;BHOWAL P;OLIVA D;SARKAR R";BLEAFNET A BONFERRONI MEAN OPERATOR BASED FUSION OF CNN MODELS FOR PLANT IDENTIFICATION USING LEAF IMAGE CLASSIFICATION;PLANTS, THE ONLY NATURAL SOURCE OF OXYGEN, ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCES FOR EVERY SPECIES IN THE WORLD. A PROPER IDENTIFICATION OF PLANTS IS IMPORTANT FOR DIFFERENT FIELDS. THE OBSERVATION OF LEAF CHARACTERISTICS IS A POPULAR METHOD AS LEAVES ARE EASILY AVAILABLE FOR EXAMINATION. RESEARCHERS ARE INCREASINGLY APPLYING IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF PLANTS BASED ON LEAF IMAGES. IN THIS PAPER, WE HAVE PROPOSED A LEAF IMAGE CLASSIFICATION MODEL, CALLED BLEAFNET, FOR PLANT IDENTIFICATION, WHERE THE CONCEPT OF DEEP LEARNING IS COMBINED WITH BONFERRONI FUSION LEARNING. INITIALLY, WE HAVE DESIGNED FIVE CLASSIFICATION MODELS, USING RESNET-50 ARCHITECTURE, WHERE FIVE DIFFERENT INPUTS ARE SEPARATELY USED IN THE MODELS. THE INPUTS ARE THE FIVE VARIANTS OF THE LEAF GRAYSCALE IMAGES, RGB, AND THREE INDIVIDUAL CHANNELS OF RGB - RED, GREEN, AND BLUE. FOR FUSION OF THE FIVE RESNET-50 OUTPUTS, WE HAVE USED THE BONFERRONI MEAN OPERATOR AS IT EXPRESSES BETTER CONNECTIVITY AMONG THE CONFIDENCE SCORES, AND IT ALSO OBTAINS BETTER RESULTS THAN THE INDIVIDUAL MODELS. WE HAVE ALSO PROPOSED A TWO-TIER TRAINING METHOD FOR PROPERLY TRAINING THE END-TO-END MODEL. TO EVALUATE THE PROPOSED MODEL, WE HAVE USED THE MALAYAKEW DATASET, COLLECTED AT THE ROYAL BOTANIC GARDENS IN NEW ENGLAND, WHICH IS A VERY CHALLENGING DATASET AS MANY LEAVES FROM DIFFERENT SPECIES HAVE A VERY SIMILAR APPEARANCE. BESIDES, THE PROPOSED METHOD IS EVALUATED USING THE LEAFSNAP AND THE FLAVIA DATASETS.

"HUSSEIN B;MALIK O;ONG W;SLIK J";RECONSTRUCTION OF DAMAGED HERBARIUM LEAVES USING DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES FOR IMPROVING CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY;LEAF IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY USED ORGANS FOR SPECIES IDENTIFICATION. THE TRADITIONAL IDENTIFICATION PROCESS INVOLVES A MANUAL ANALYSIS OF INDIVIDUAL DRIED OR FRESH LEAF'S FEATURES BY THE BOTANISTS. RECENT ADVANCEMENTS IN COMPUTER VISION TECHNIQUES HAVE ASSISTED IN AUTOMATING THE PLANTS FAMILIES/SPECIES IDENTIFICATION PROCESS BASED ON THE DIGITAL IMAGES OF LEAVES. HOWEVER, MOST OF THE EXISTING STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON USING DATASETS FOR FRESH AND INTACT LEAVES. A HUGE AMOUNT OF DATA FOR PRESERVED PLANTS IN THE FORM OF DIGITIZED HERBARIA SPECIMENS HAVE NOT BEEN EFFECTIVELY UTILIZED FOR THE TASK OF AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION BECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE OF DAMAGED LEAVES IN SPECIMENS. IN THIS STUDY, DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AS A TOOL FOR RECONSTRUCTING THE DAMAGED HERBARIUM LEAVES IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE USEFULNESS OF THE DIGITIZED SPECIMENS FOR AUTOMATED PLANT IDENTIFICATION TASK BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL SAMPLES OF LEAVES. THE RECONSTRUCTION RESULTS OF TWO DIFFERENT FAMILIES OF CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS) HAVE BEEN COMPARED FOR DATA FROM TEN DIFFERENT PLANT FAMILIES NAMELY ANACARDIACEAE, ANNONACEAE, DIPTEROCARPACEAE, EBENACEAE, EUPHORBIACEAE, MALVACEAE, PHYLLANTHACEAE, POLYGALACEAE, RUBIACEAE AND SAPOTACEAE. THE PERFORMANCE OF AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION TASK WAS IMPROVED BY MORE THAN 20% USING THE RECONSTRUCTED LEAVES IMAGES AS COMPARED TO USING THE ORIGINAL DATA (I.E. IMAGES OF SPECIMENS WITH DAMAGED LEAVES).

AUTOMATED APPROACHES, INCLUDING MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING, ARE INCREASINGLY BEING APPLIED TO SURMOUNT THESE CHALLENGES. FOR THIS, ACCURATE MODELS ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE RELIABLE PREDICTIONS AND GUIDE THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS. SO FAR, THESE TWO PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED SEPARATELY, AND LIKEWISE, SEPARATE MODELS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR EACH OF THESE TWO PROBLEMS, BUT CONSIDERING THAT PLANT SPECIES AND PLANT DISEASE PREDICTION ARE OFTEN RELATED TASKS, THEY CAN BE CONSIDERED TOGETHER. WE THEREFORE PROPOSE AND VALIDATE A NOVEL APPROACH BASED ON THE MULTI-TASK LEARNING STRATEGY, USING SHARED REPRESENTATIONS BETWEEN THESE RELATED TASKS, BECAUSE THEY PERFORM BETTER THAN INDIVIDUAL MODELS. WE APPLY A MULTI-INPUT NETWORK THAT USES RAW IMAGES AND TRANSFERRED DEEP FEATURES EXTRACTED FROM A PRE-TRAINED DEEP MODEL TO PREDICT EACH PLANT'S TYPE AND DISEASE.

THIS WORK PROPOSED AN APPROACH FOR IDENTIFYING 15 LAURACEAE SPECIES AND 20 FAGACEAE SPECIES USING LEAF IMAGES AND CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS). LEAF SPECIMENS OF 35 SPECIES WERE COLLECTED FROM THE NORTHERN, CENTRAL, AND SOUTHERN PARTS OF TAIWAN. IMAGES OF THE LEAVES WERE ACQUIRED USING FLAT-BED SCANNERS.

"THANIKKAL J;DUBEY A;THOMAS M";UNIQUE SHAPE DESCRIPTOR ALGORITHM FOR MEDICINAL PLANT IDENTIFICATION SDAMPI WITH ABRIDGED IMAGE DATABASE;IN IMAGE PROCESSING, LEAF SHAPE RECOGNITION REQUIRES A HUGE DATABASE OF SIMILAR IMAGES. NORMAL LEAF IMAGE DATABASE CONSTRUCTION REQUIRES MORE TIME AND SPACE. ON THE OTHER HAND, MOBILE OFFLINE APPLICATIONS ARE NOT ABLE TO CONTAIN HUGE IMAGE DATABASE WITH HIGH PIXEL RATIO. TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM, MAINLY IN MEDICINAL PLANT IDENTIFICATION, SMALL LEAF DESCRIPTORS ARE NECESSARY TO COMPLETELY PROVIDE THE REQUIRED PLANT INFORMATION. PRESENTLY, THE BOTANISTS USE SHAPE REFERENCE TABLE TO RECOGNIZE THE FOLLOWING SHAPES OF THE LEAF: OVATE, CORDATE, ELLIPTICAL, OBLONG, LANCEOLATE AND LINEAR. AS THE SHAPE NUMBERS ARE INVARIANT UNDER SCALE, ROTATION AND TRANSLATION, WHICH IS HIGHLY DESIRABLE PROPERTY FOR OBJECT RECOGNITION AND CHAIN CODE TECHNIQUES PRESERVE DATA BY ALLOWING LARGE DATA REDUCTION. HENCE, IN THE PROPOSED SHAPE DESCRIPTOR ALGORITHM FOR MEDICINAL PLANT IDENTIFICATION (SDAMPI), WE DEVELOPED A DESCRIPTOR TO RESOLVE THE PIXEL SELECTION ISSUE OF FREEMAN CHAIN CODE AND GENERATE A UNIQUE LEAF SHAPE NUMBER. THIS LEAF SHAPE DIGITAL DESCRIPTOR WILL ACT AS A REFERENCE TABLE FOR MEDICINAL PLANT LEAF SHAPE IDENTIFICATION. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED DESCRIPTOR IS EVALUATED THROUGH JACCARD SIMILARITY INDEX GRAPH AND LEVENSHTEIN DISTANCE (LD) GRAPH. FROM THE RESULTS, IT IS CONFIRMING THAT, SDAMPI DESCRIPTOR CAN DETECT MEDICINAL PLANT LEAF SHAPES MORE ACCURATELY THAN EXISTING METHODS.

"AHMED A;HUSSEIN S";LEAF IDENTIFICATION USING RADIAL BASIS FUNCTION NEURAL NETWORKS AND SSA BASED SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE;"IN THIS RESEARCH, AN EFFICIENT SCHEME TO IDENTIFY LEAF TYPES IS PROPOSED. IN THAT SCHEME, THE LEAF BOUNDARY POINTS ARE FITTED IN A CONTINUOUS CONTOUR USING RADIAL BASIS FUNCTION NEURAL NETWORKS (RBFNN) TO CALCULATE THE CENTROID OF THE LEAF SHAPE. AFTERWARDS, THE DISTANCES BETWEEN PREDETERMINED POINTS AND THE CENTROID WERE COMPUTED AND NORMALIZED. IN ADDITION, THE TIME COMPLEXITY OF THE FEATURES' EXTRACTION ALGORITHM WAS CALCULATED. THE MERIT OF THIS SCHEME IS OBJECTS' INDEPENDENCE TO TRANSLATION, ROTATION AND SCALING. MOREOVER, DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATION TECHNIQUES WERE EVALUATED AGAINST THE LEAF SHAPE FEATURES. THOSE TECHNIQUES INCLUDED TWO OF THE MOST COMMONLY USED CLASSIFICATION METHODS; RBFNN AND SVM THAT WERE EVALUATED AND COMPARED WITH OTHER RESEARCHES THAT USED COMPLEX FEATURES EXTRACTION ALGORITHMS WITH MUCH HIGHER DIMENSIONALITY. FURTHERMORE, A THIRD CLASSIFICATION METHOD WITH AN OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUE FOR THE SVM USING SALP SWARM ALGORITHM (SSA) WAS UTILIZED SHOWING A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OVER RBFNN AND SVM.";NA;"SHAPE-FEATURES; PLANT-IDENTIFICATION; RECOGNITION; CLASSIFICATION;; ALGORITHM; IMAGES";PLOS ONE;8;2020;ENGLISH;ARTICLE;10.1371/journal.pone.0237645
"BECK M;LIU C;BIDINOSTI C;HENRY C;GODEE C;AJMANI M";AN EMBEDDED SYSTEM FOR THE AUTOMATED GENERATION OF LABELED PLANT IMAGES TO ENABLE MACHINE LEARNING APPLICATIONS IN AGRICULTURE;"A LACK OF SUFFICIENT TRAINING DATA, BOTH IN TERMS OF VARIETY AND QUANTITY, IS OFTEN THE BOTTLENECK IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MACHINE LEARNING (ML) APPLICATIONS IN ANY DOMAIN. FOR AGRICULTURAL APPLICATIONS, ML-BASED MODELS DESIGNED TO PERFORM TASKS SUCH AS AUTONOMOUS PLANT CLASSIFICATION WILL TYPICALLY BE COUPLED TO JUST ONE OR PERHAPS A FEW PLANT SPECIES. AS A CONSEQUENCE, EACH CROP-SPECIFIC TASK IS VERY LIKELY TO REQUIRE ITS OWN SPECIALIZED TRAINING DATA, AND THE QUESTION OF HOW TO SERVE THIS NEED FOR DATA NOW OFTEN OVERSHADOWS THE MORE ROUTINE EXERCISE OF ACTUALLY TRAINING SUCH MODELS. TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM, WE HAVE DEVELOPED AN EMBEDDED ROBOTIC SYSTEM TO AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE AND LABEL LARGE DATASETS OF PLANT IMAGES FOR ML APPLICATIONS IN AGRICULTURE. THE SYSTEM CAN IMAGE PLANTS FROM VIRTUALLY ANY ANGLE, THEREBY ENSURING A WIDE VARIETY OF DATA; AND WITH AN IMAGING RATE OF UP TO ONE IMAGE PER SECOND, IT CAN PRODUCE LABLELED DATASETS ON THE SCALE OF THOUSANDS TO TENS OF THOUSANDS OF IMAGES PER DAY. AS SUCH, THIS SYSTEM OFFERS AN IMPORTANT ALTERNATIVE TO TIME- AND COST-INTENSIVE METHODS OF MANUAL GENERATION AND LABELING. FURTHERMORE, THE USE OF A UNIFORM BACKGROUND MADE OF BLUE KEYING FABRIC ENABLES ADDITIONAL IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES SUCH AS BACKGROUND REPLACEMENT AND IMAGE SEGEMENTATION. IT ALSO HELPS IN THE TRAINING PROCESS, ESSENTIALLY FORCING THE MODEL TO FOCUS ON THE PLANT FEATURES AND ELIMINATING RANDOM CORRELATIONS. TO DEMONSTRATE THE CAPABILITIES OF OUR SYSTEM, WE GENERATED A DATASET OF OVER 34,000 LABELED IMAGES, WITH WHICH WE TRAINED AN ML-MODEL TO DISTINGUISH GRASSES FROM NON-GRASSES IN TEST DATA FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES. WE NOW PLAN TO GENERATE MUCH LARGER DATASETS OF CANADIAN CROP PLANTS AND WEEDS THAT WILL BE MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE IN THE HOPE OF FURTHER ENABLING ML APPLICATIONS IN THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR.

"WANG H;ZHANG G;QI H";WOOD RECOGNITION USING IMAGE TEXTURE FEATURES;INSPIRED BY THEORIES OF HIGHER LOCAL ORDER AUTOCORRELATION (HLAC), THIS PAPER PRESENTS A SIMPLE, NOVEL, YET VERY POWERFUL APPROACH FOR WOOD RECOGNITION. THE METHOD IS SUITABLE FOR WOOD DATABASE APPLICATIONS, WHICH ARE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE IN WOOD RELATED INDUSTRIES AND ADMINISTRATIONS. AT THE FEATURE EXTRACTION STAGE, A SET OF FEATURES IS EXTRACTED FROM MASK MATCHING IMAGE (MMI). THE MMI FEATURES PRESERVE THE MASK MATCHING INFORMATION GATHERED FROM THE HLAC METHODS. THE TEXTURE INFORMATION IN THE IMAGE CAN THEN BE ACCURATELY EXTRACTED FROM THE STATISTICAL AND GEOMETRICAL FEATURES. IN PARTICULAR, RICHER INFORMATION AND ENHANCED DISCRIMINATIVE POWER IS ACHIEVED THROUGH THE LENGTH HISTOGRAM, A NEW HISTOGRAM THAT EMBODIES THE WIDTH AND HEIGHT HISTOGRAMS. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH IS COMPARED TO THE STATE-OF-THE-ART HLAC APPROACHES USING THE WOOD STEREOGRAM DATASET ZAFU WS 24.

"YANG Z;HE W;FAN X;TJAHJADI T";PLANTNET TRANSFER LEARNINGBASED FINEGRAINED NETWORK FOR HIGHTHROUGHPUT PLANTS RECOGNITION;IN HIGH-THROUGHPUT PHENOTYPING, RECOGNIZING INDIVIDUAL PLANT CATEGORIES IS A VITAL SUPPORT PROCESS FOR PLANT BREEDING. HOWEVER, DIFFERENT PLANT CATEGORIES HAVE DIFFERENT FINE-GRAINED CHARACTERISTICS, I.E., INTRA-CLASS VARIATION AND INTER-CLASS SIMILARITY, MAKING THE PROCESS CHALLENGING. EXISTING DEEP LEARNING-BASED RECOGNITION METHODS FAIL TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THIS RECOGNITION TASK UNDER CHALLENGING REQUIREMENTS, LEADING TO TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES SUCH AS LOW ACCURACY AND LACK OF GENERALIZATION ROBUSTNESS. TO ADDRESS THESE REQUIREMENTS, THIS PAPER PROPOSES PLANTNET, A FINE-GRAINED NETWORK FOR PLANT RECOGNITION BASED ON TRANSFER LEARNING AND A BILINEAR CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK, WHICH ACHIEVES HIGH RECOGNITION ACCURACY IN HIGH-THROUGHPUT PHENOTYPING REQUIREMENTS. THE NETWORK OPERATES AS FOLLOWS. FIRST, TWO DEEP FEATURE EXTRACTORS ARE CONSTRUCTED USING TRANSFER LEARNING. THE OUTER PRODUCT OF THE DIFFERENT SPATIAL LOCATIONS CORRESPONDING TO THE TWO FEATURES IS THEN CALCULATED, AND THE BILINEAR CONVERGENCE IS COMPUTED FOR THE DIFFERENT SPATIAL LOCATIONS. FINALLY, THE FUSED BILINEAR VECTORS ARE NORMALIZED VIA MAXIMUM EXPECTATION TO GENERATE THE NETWORK OUTPUT. EXPERIMENTS ON A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ARABIDOPSIS DATASET SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED BILINEAR MODEL PERFORMED BETTER THAN RELATED STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS. THE INTERCLASS RECOGNITION ACCURACY OF THE FOUR DIFFERENT SPECIES OF ARABIDOPSIS SF-2, CVI, LANDSBERG AND COLUMBIA ARE FOUND TO BE 98.48%, 96.53%, 96.79% AND 97.33%, RESPECTIVELY, WITH AN AVERAGE ACCURACY OF 97.25%.

"KARADENIZ A;Ã‡ELIK Y;BAÅžARAN E";CLASSIFICATION OF WALNUT VARIETIES OBTAINED FROM WALNUT LEAF IMAGES BY THE RECOMMENDED RESIDUAL BLOCK BASED CNN MODEL;WALNUTS ARE WIDELY USED, ALTHOUGH THEY COME IN A VARIETY OF TYPES AND QUALITIES. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO CHOOSE THE CORRECT WALNUT VARIETY WITH THE NECESSARY ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS TO CONTINUE THE PRODUCTION OF WALNUT FRUIT, WHICH HAS POSITIVE BENEFITS ON HUMAN HEALTH. BECAUSE PLANTING A WALNUT GARDEN IS EXPENSIVE AND THE HARVESTING PROCESS TAKES A WHILE. HOWEVER, SINCE THE COLOUR AND FEEL OF WALNUT LEAVES ARE SO SIMILAR, IT CAN BE CHALLENGING TO TELL THEM APART. EXPERTS MUST DEVOTE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME TO DIFFERENTIATING WALNUT KINDS, AND MORPHOLOGICAL TESTS SHOULD BE CONDUCTED. THERE ARE DIFFERENT STUDIES IN THE LITERATURE FOR WALNUT VARIETY DIFFERENTIATION. NEVERTHELESS, THOSE ARE STUDIES CONDUCTED WITH THE CLASSIFICATION OF A SMALL NUMBER OF WALNUT VARIETIES OR LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS. WITH THE ADVANCEMENT OF TECHNOLOGY, DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES BASED ON COMPUTERS ARE NOW ROUTINELY UTILIZED FOR LEAF RECOGNITION. THESE TECHNOLOGIES ENABLE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN ERROR RATES, TIME SAVES, AND COST. WITH A TOTAL OF 1751 LEAF PICTURES COLLECTED FROM 18 SPECIES OF WALNUTS, A SPECIAL WALNUT DATASET WAS CONSTRUCTED FOR THIS STUDY IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY WALNUT TYPES FROM WALNUT LEAVES. TO AUTOMATICALLY CLASSIFY THE PROVIDED DATASET, IMAGES ARE TRAINED WITH RESIDUAL BLOCK-BASED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURES. FOLLOWING THE DISCOVERY OF EACH IMAGE'S DEEP FEATURES, THE ATOM SEARCH OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM WAS USED TO CHOOSE THE MOST DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS. SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES (SVM) WERE USED TO CLASSIFY WALNUT SPECIES WITH THE NEW FEATURE SET CREATED.

BAKHSHIPOUR A;CASCADING FEATURE FILTERING AND BOOSTING ALGORITHM FOR PLANT TYPE CLASSIFICATION BASED ON IMAGE FEATURES;CROP AND WEEDS IDENTIFICATION IS OF IMPORTANT STEPS TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFICIENT AUTOMOTIVE WEED CONTROL SYSTEMS. THE HIGHER THE ACCURACY OF PLANT DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION, THE HIGHER THE PERFORMANCE OF THE WEEDING MACHINE. IN THIS STUDY, THE CAPABILITY OF TWO POPULAR BOOSTING METHODS INCLUDING ADABOOST.M1 AND LOGITBOOST ALGORITHMS WAS EVALUATED TO ENHANCE THE PLANT CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE OF FOUR CLASSIFIERS, NAMELY MULTI-LAYER PERCEPTRON (MLP), K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS (KNN), RANDOM FOREST (RF), AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM). FOUR FEATURE FILTERING TECHNIQUES INCLUDING CORRELATION-BASED FEATURE SELECTION (CFS), INFORMATION GAIN (IG), GAIN RATIO (GR), AND ONER WERE APPLIED TO THE IMAGE-EXTRACTED FEATURES AND 10 OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FEATURES WERE SELECTED AND FED INTO SINGLE AND BOOSTED CLASSIFIERS. THE RF MODEL TRAINED BY IG SELECTED FEATURES (IG-RF) WAS THE MOST APPROPRIATE CLASSIFIER AMONG THE EVALUATED MODELS WHETHER IN SINGLE OR BOOSTED MODES. IT WAS ALSO FOUND THAT BOOSTING OF IG-RF BY USING ADABOOST.M1 AND LOGITBOOST ALGORITHMS IMPROVED THE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY. REGARDING THE PERFORMANCE VALUES, THE LOGITBOOST-IG-RF STRUCTURE, WHICH PROVIDED A CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY OF 99.58%, A KAPPA (K) OF 0.9948, AND A ROOT MEAN SQUARED ERROR (RMSE) OF 0.0688 ON TRAINING DATASET, WAS SELECTED AS THE MOST APPROPRIATE CLASSIFIER FOR PLANT DISCRIMINATION IN PEANUT FIELDS. THE ACCURACY, K, AND RMSE CRITERIA OF THIS COMBINATION ON TEST DATASET WERE 95.00%, 0.9375, AND 0.1591, RESPECTIVELY. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT COMBINATION OF BOOSTING ALGORITHMS AND FEATURE SELECTION METHODS CAN PROMOTE PLANT TYPE DISCRIMINATION ACCURACY, WHICH IS A CRUCIAL FACTOR IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRECISION WEED CONTROL SYSTEMS.

HUIXIAN J;THE ANALYSIS OF PLANTS IMAGE RECOGNITION BASED ON DEEP LEARNING AND ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK;CLASSIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF PLANTS ARE HELPFUL FOR PEOPLE TO EFFECTIVELY UNDERSTAND AND PROTECT PLANTS. THE LEAVES OF PLANTS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT RECOGNITION ORGANS. WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE VISION TECHNOLOGY, PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY BASED ON IMAGE ANALYSIS IS USED TO IMPROVE THE KNOWLEDGE OF PLANT CLASSIFICATION AND PROTECTION. DEEP LEARNING IS THE ABBREVIATION OF DEEP NEURAL NETWORK LEARNING METHOD AND BELONGS TO NEURAL NETWORK STRUCTURE. IT CAN AUTOMATICALLY LEARN FEATURES FROM BIG DATA AND USE ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK BASED ON BACK PROPAGATION ALGORITHM TO TRAIN AND CLASSIFY PLANT LEAF SAMPLES. THE MAIN CONTENT OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXTRACT PLANT LEAF FEATURES AND IDENTIFY PLANT SPECIES BASED ON IMAGE ANALYSIS. FIRSTLY, PLANT LEAF IMAGES ARE SEGMENTED BY VARIOUS METHODS, AND THEN FEATURE EXTRACTION ALGORITHM IS USED TO EXTRACT LEAF SHAPE AND TEXTURE FEATURES FROM LEAF SAMPLE IMAGES. THEN THE COMPREHENSIVE CHARACTERISTIC INFORMATION OF PLANT LEAVES IS FORMED ACCORDING TO THE COMPREHENSIVE CHARACTERISTIC INFORMATION. IN THIS PAPER, 50 PLANT LEAF DATABASES ARE TESTED AND COMPARED WITH KNN-BASED NEIGHBORHOOD CLASSIFICATION, KOHONEN NETWORK BASED ON SELF-ORGANIZING FEATURE MAPPING ALGORITHM AND SVM-BASED SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE. AT THE SAME TIME, THE LEAVES OF 7 DIFFERENT PLANTS WERE COMPARED AND IT WAS FOUND THAT GINKGO LEAVES WERE EASIER TO IDENTIFY. FOR LEAF IMAGES UNDER COMPLEX BACKGROUND, GOOD RECOGNITION EFFECT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED. IMAGE SAMPLES OF THE TEST SET ARE INPUT INTO THE LEARNING MODEL TO OBTAIN RECONSTRUCTION ERRORS. THE CLASS LABEL OF THE TEST SET CAN BE OBTAINED BY RECONSTRUCTING THE DEEP LEARNING MODEL WITH THE SMALLEST ERROR SET. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THIS METHOD HAS THE SHORTEST RECOGNITION TIME AND THE HIGHEST CORRECT RECOGNITION RATE.

"KANDA P;XIA K;SANUSI O";A DEEP LEARNING BASED RECOGNITION TECHNIQUE FOR PLANT LEAF CLASSIFICATION;IN THE PRACTICE OF PLANT CLASSIFICATION, THE DESIGN OF HAND-CRAFTED FEATURES IS MORE DEPENDENT ON THE ABILITY OF COMPUTER VISION EXPERTS TO ENCODE MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS THAT ARE PREDEFINED BY BOTANISTS. HOWEVER, THE DISTINCT FEATURES THAT EACH PLANT HAS AS DEMONSTRATED BY ITS LEAVES CAN BE AUTOMATICALLY LEARNED BASED ON THE END-TO-END ADVANTAGE OF DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS. THEREFORE, DEEP LEARNING BASED PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION METHODS IS AN IMPORTANT APPROACH NOWADAYS. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE ARE APPLYING THREE TECHNOLOGIES TO ACHIEVE A MODEL WITH HIGH ACCURACY FOR PLANT CLASSIFICATION. A CONDITIONAL GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORK WAS USED TO GENERATE SYNTHETIC DATA, A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK WAS USED FOR FEATURE EXTRACTION AND THE RICH EXTRACTED FEATURES WERE FED INTO A LOGISTIC REGRESSION CLASSIFIER FOR EFFICIENT CLASSIFICATION OF THE PLANT SPECIES. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS METHOD CAN BE SEEN IN THE WEALTH OF PLANT DATASETS THAT IT WAS TESTED ON. THE PAPER CONTAINS RESULTS ON SEVEN DATASETS WITH DIFFERENT MODALITIES. WE UTILIZED BOTH DEEP LEARNING AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION IN EFFECTIVELY CLASSIFYING THE PLANTS USING THEIR LEAF IMAGES WITH ACCURACIES AVERAGING 96.1% FOR ABOUT EIGHT DATASETS USED, BUT GREATER FOR THE INDIVIDUAL DATASETS FROM 99.0 TO 100% ON SOME INDIVIDUAL DATASETS. EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTS ON EACH OF THE DATASETS DEMONSTRATE THE SUPERIORITY OF OUR METHOD COMPARED WITH OTHERS AND ARE HIGHLIGHTED IN OUR RESULTS.

"KUMAR M;GUPTA S;GAO X;SINGH A";PLANT SPECIES RECOGNITION USING MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES AND ADAPTIVE BOOSTING METHODOLOGY;PLANT SPECIES DETECTION AIMS AT THE AUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION OF PLANTS. ALTHOUGH A LOT OF ASPECTS LIKE LEAF, FLOWERS, FRUITS, SEEDS COULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE DECISION, BUT LEAF FEATURES ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT. AS A PLANT LEAF IS ALWAYS MORE ACCESSIBLE AS COMPARED TO OTHER PARTS OF THE PLANTS, IT IS OBVIOUS TO STUDY IT FOR PLANT IDENTIFICATION. THE PRESENT PAPER INTRODUCED A NOVEL PLANT SPECIES CLASSIFIER BASED ON THE EXTRACTION OF MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES USING A MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON WITH ADABOOSTING. THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK COMPRISES PRE-PROCESSING, FEATURE EXTRACTION, FEATURE SELECTION, AND CLASSIFICATION. INITIALLY, SOME PRE-PROCESSING TECHNIQUES ARE USED TO SET UP A LEAF IMAGE FOR THE FEATURE EXTRACTION PROCESS. VARIOUS MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES, I.E., CENTROID, MAJOR AXIS LENGTH, MINOR AXIS LENGTH, SOLIDITY, PERIMETER, AND ORIENTATION ARE EXTRACTED FROM THE DIGITAL IMAGES OF VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF LEAVES. DIFFERENT CLASSIFIERS, I.E., K-NN, DECISION TREE AND MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON ARE EMPLOYED TO TEST THE ACCURACY OF THE ALGORITHM. ADABOOST METHODOLOGY IS EXPLORED FOR IMPROVING THE PRECISION RATE OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM.

THE WORK CONCENTRATES ON ADOPTING THE TRANSFER LEARNING TECHNIQUE ON THE PRE-TRAINED MODELS TO EXTRACT FEATURES AND CLASSIFY USING ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK (ANN) AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM). THE SVM HYPERPARAMETERS ARE TUNED FURTHER BY BAYESIAN OPTIMIZATION TO ACHIEVE A BETTER PERFORMANCE MODEL. THE PROPOSED DEEPHERB MODEL LEARNED FROM XCEPTION AND ANN OUTPERFORMED BY 97.5% ACCURACY. A CROSS-PLATFORM MOBILE APPLICATION ENTITLED HERBSNAP DEVELOPED INTEGRATING THE DEEPHERB MODEL IDENTIFIES THE HERB IMAGE WITH A PREDICTION TIME OF 1 SECOND PER IMAGE AND REVEALS THE PERTINENT DETAILS OF HERBS FROM THE DATABASE. THIS RESEARCH WILL FURTHER FOCUS ON EXPANDING THE DATASET TO BENEFIT STAKEHOLDERS AND THUS, ENRICHES SOCIETY WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF HERBS AND THEIR MEDICINAL PROPERTIES.

"SHI Y;MA D;LV J;LI J";ACTL ASYMMETRIC CONVOLUTIONAL TRANSFER LEARNING FOR TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION BASED ON DEEP NEURAL NETWORK;THE IDENTIFICATION OF TREE SPECIES IS OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE TO THE SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT AND UTILIZATION OF FOREST ECOSYSTEMS. HYPERSPECTRAL DATA PROVIDE SUFFICIENT SPECTRAL AND SPATIAL INFORMATION TO CLASSIFY TREE SPECIES. CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNN) HAVE ACHIEVED GREAT SUCCESS IN HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGE (HSI) CLASSIFICATION. THE OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE OF CNN IN HSI CLASSIFICATION RELIES ON SUFFICIENT TRAINING SAMPLES. HOWEVER, IT'S EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING TO ACQUIRE LABELED TRAINING SAMPLES. IN THIS ARTICLE, A NOVEL ASYMMETRIC CONVOLUTIONAL TRANSFER LEARNING MODEL FOR HSI CLASSIFICATION IS PROPOSED. FIRST, THE TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION DATASET IS BUILT FROM GODDARD'S LIDAR, HYPERSPECTRAL THERMAL (G-LIHT) DATA. THEN, THE ASYMMETRIC CONVOLUTIONAL TRANSFER LEARNING MODEL AND WEIGHTS TRAINED ON IMAGENET DATASET ARE USED TO INITIALIZE THE WEIGHTS OF THE HSI CLASSIFICATION MODEL. FINALLY, A WELL FINE-TUNED NEURAL NETWORK ON TREE SPECIES DATASET IS USED TO PERFORM THE HSI CLASSIFICATION TASK. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS REVEAL THAT THE PROPOSED MODEL WITH ASYMMETRIC CONVOLUTIONAL BLOCKS EFFECTIVELY IMPROVES THE ACCURACY OF HOWLAND FOREST TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION AND PROVIDES A NEW IDEA FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF HYPERSPECTRAL REMOTE SENSING IMAGES.

"SONG Y;HE F;ZHANG X";TO IDENTIFY TREE SPECIES WITH HIGHLY SIMILAR LEAVES BASED ON A NOVEL ATTENTION MECHANISM FOR CNN;IMAGE IDENTIFICATION TECHNOLOGY HAS GREAT SIGNIFICANCE FOR FORESTRY PRODUCTION AND FORESTRY MANAGEMENT. HIGHLY SIMILAR OBJECT IDENTIFICATION TASKS, SUCH AS TREE SPECIES WITH SIMILAR LEAVES, ARE EXTREMELY CHALLENGING. SIMPLY USING TYPICAL CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS) OR SIMPLY ADDING MORE CONVOLUTIONAL LAYERS STILL PERFORMS POORLY IN THE ABOVE TASKS. IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT A NOVEL ATTENTION MECHANISM TO ENHANCE THE CNN FOR IDENTIFICATION OF TREE SPECIES WITH HIGHLY SIMILAR LEAVES. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A HIGHLY DISCRIMINATIVE NETWORK, NAMELY ATTENTION BRANCH BASED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (ABCNN), TO BETTER DISTINGUISH THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LEAVES FEATURES. FIRSTLY, WE PROPOSED A NOVEL STRUCTURE, IN WHICH AN ATTENTION BRANCH IS ADDED IN ALL BLOCK LAYERS OF NETWORK BESIDES THE TYPICAL NORMAL BRANCH. SECONDLY, OUR ATTENTION BRANCH ADOPTS A CONDENSATION PROCESS TO OBTAIN A REGION OF INTEREST (ROI) FROM GLOBAL INFORMATION OF INPUT AND DESIGNS A RECONSTRUCTION PROCESS TO AMPLIFY THE FEATURES DIFFERENCE TO FOCUS ON THE ROI. THIRDLY, WE DESIGN A FUSION PROCESS, WHICH CAREFULLY COMBINES THE ATTENTION BRANCH WITH A NORMAL BRANCH TO IMPROVE THE NETWORK PERFORMANCE IN THE TRAINING PROCESS. THE PROPOSED ABCNN IS TESTED ON SPECIAL DATASET OF LEAFSNAP WITH HIGHLY SIMILAR TREE LEAVES. OUR APPROACH ACHIEVED 91.43% CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY, WHICH IS HIGHER THAN PREVIOUS METHODS. FURTHERMORE, ABCNN IS ALSO TESTED ON GENERAL DATA SET OF SVHN AND OBTAINS 98.27% CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY, WHICH IS THE MOST COMPETITIVE WHEN CONSIDERING THE LOWER COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES FOR ORDINARY APPLICATIONS. BOTH ABOVE EXPERIMENTS DEMONSTRATE THE DISCRIMINATION AND ROBUSTNESS OF THE PROPOSED METHOD.

"SU J;WANG M;WU Z;CHEN Q";FAST PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION USING IMPROVED MULTISCALE TRIANGLE REPRESENTATION AND KNN FOR OPTIMIZATION;DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY AND SIMILARITY OF PLANT LEAVES, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO STUDY AN EFFECTIVE LEAF-FEATURE EXTRACTION METHOD TO IMPROVE THE RECOGNITION RATE OF PLANT LEAVES. WE STUDY FIVE MULTI-SCALE TRIANGLE REPRESENTATIONS: THE TRIANGLE UNSIGNED AREA REPRESENTATION (TUA), THE TRIANGLE VERTEX ANGLE REPRESENTATION (TVA) AND THREE NEW REPRESENTATIONS, WHICH WE DEFINE AS THE GRAY AVERAGE (TGA), THE GRAY STANDARD DEVIATION (TGSD) AND THE SIDE LENGTH INTEGRAL (TSLI) ON THE TRIANGLE. IN THIS METHOD THE CURVATURE FEATURES OF THE CONTOUR, THE TEXTURE FEATURES AND THE SHAPE AREA FEATURE ARE EXTRACTED TO PROVIDE A MULTISCALE LEAF-FEATURE DESCRIPTION, AND A NEW ADAPTIVE KNN FOR OPTIMIZATION METHOD IS PROPOSED TO IMPROVE THE RETRIEVAL RATE OF LEAF DATASETS. EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT COMPARED WITH THE STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS, OUR METHOD HAS HIGHER ACCURACY ON THE SWEDISH AND FLAVIA PLANT LEAF DATASETS, WHICH ARE RESPECTIVELY 99.35% AND 99.43% WITH 84.76% MEAN AVERAGE PRECISION (MAP) VALUE AND HAS COMPARABLE RESULTS ON MPEG-7, KIMIA99 AND KIMIA216 DATASETS. WHEN OUR METHOD IS COMBINED WITH KNN FOR OPTIMIZATION, THE RETRIEVAL RATE OF THE ABOVE DATASETS HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED, ESPECIALLY MAP ON THE FLAVIA DATASET INCREASES TO 94.48%.

"WANG X;DU W;GUO F;HU S";LEAF RECOGNITION BASED ON ELLIPTICAL HALF GABOR AND MAXIMUM GAP LOCAL LINE DIRECTION PATTERN;PLANT IDENTIFICATION VIA LEAF IMAGES IS VERY MEANINGFUL TO AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION. THE EXISTING METHODS WERE BASED ON ONE OR TWO KINDS OF THE THREE DISTINCT CHARACTERISTICS IN LEAF IMAGES INCLUDING LEAF CONTOURS, TEXTURES AND VEINS. THIS LIMITS THEIR RECOGNITION PERFORMANCE AND SCOPE OF APPLICATION. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES A NOVEL COUNTING-BASED LEAF RECOGNITION METHOD, WHICH CAN DIRECTLY AND EFFECTIVELY COMBINE ALL OF THE THREE KINDS OF SIGNIFICANT CHARACTERISTICS IN LEAF IMAGES. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE STABLE AND INDEPENDENT LOCAL LINE RESPONSES FROM LEAF CONTOUR, TEXTURE AND VEIN, ELLIPTICAL HALF GABOR IS INTRODUCED AND CONVOLUTED WITH THE RAW GRAYSCALE LEAF IMAGES, AND THEN MAXIMUM GAP LOCAL LINE DIRECTION PATTERNS ARE EXTRACTED FROM THE LOCAL LINE RESPONSES AND NORMALIZED IN DIRECTION BY CYCLICALLY RIGHT SHIFTING THESE PATTERNS UNTIL THE MOST NUMEROUS BIT PLANE WITH A VALUE OF 1 TO THE LEFT BIT. THE HISTOGRAM OF THE NORMALIZED PATTERNS IS CALCULATED AND REGARDED AS THE COUNTING-BASED LOCAL STRUCTURE DESCRIPTOR, AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE IS UTILIZED AS THE CLASSIFIER.

RESULTS SHOW THE POTENTIAL OF DEEP LEARNING ON HERBARIUM SPECIES IDENTIFICATION, PARTICULARLY BY TRAINING AND TESTING ACROSS DIFFERENT DATASETS FROM DIFFERENT HERBARIA. THIS COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO THE CREATION OF A SEMI, OR EVEN FULLY AUTOMATED SYSTEM TO HELP TAXONOMISTS AND EXPERTS WITH THEIR ANNOTATION, CLASSIFICATION, AND REVISION WORKS.; BACKGROUND: HUNDREDS OF HERBARIUM COLLECTIONS HAVE ACCUMULATED A VALUABLE HERITAGE AND KNOWLEDGE OF PLANTS OVER SEVERAL CENTURIES. RECENT INITIATIVES STARTED AMBITIOUS PRESERVATION PLANS TO DIGITIZE THIS INFORMATION AND MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO BOTANISTS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC THROUGH WEB PORTALS. HOWEVER, THOUSANDS OF SHEETS ARE STILL UNIDENTIFIED AT THE SPECIES LEVEL WHILE NUMEROUS SHEETS SHOULD BE REVIEWED AND UPDATED FOLLOWING MORE RECENT TAXONOMIC KNOWLEDGE. THESE ANNOTATIONS AND REVISIONS REQUIRE AN UNREALISTIC AMOUNT OF WORK FOR BOTANISTS TO CARRY OUT IN A REASONABLE TIME. COMPUTER VISION AND MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES APPLIED TO HERBARIUM SHEETS ARE PROMISING BUT ARE STILL NOT WELL STUDIED COMPARED TO AUTOMATED SPECIES IDENTIFICATION FROM LEAF SCANS OR PICTURES OF PLANTS IN THE FIELD.; RESULTS: IN THIS WORK, WE PROPOSE TO STUDY AND EVALUATE THE ACCURACY WITH WHICH HERBARIUM IMAGES CAN BE POTENTIALLY EXPLOITED FOR SPECIES IDENTIFICATION WITH DEEP LEARNING TECHNOLOGY.

"CHAKKARAVARTHY S;SAJEEVAN G;KAMALANABAN E;KUMAR K";AUTOMATIC LEAF VEIN FEATURE EXTRACTION FOR FIRST DEGREE VEINS;LEAF VEIN IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND COMPLEX FEATURE OF THE LEAF USED IN AUTOMATIC PLANT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM FOR AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF PLANT SPECIES. LEAVES OF DIFFERENT SPECIES HAVE DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES WHICH HELP IN CLASSIFICATION OF SPECIFIC PLANT SPECIES. THESE FEATURES HELP THE BOTANISTS IN IDENTIFYING THE KEY SPECIES OF THE PLANTS FROM ITS LEAF IMAGES MORE ACCURATELY. VEIN FEATURE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPLEX FEATURES OF LEAF IN PLANT SPECIES. IN THIS PAPER WE PROPOSED A NEW FEATURE EXTRACTION MODEL, TO EXTRACT THE VEIN FEATURES FROM THE LEAF IMAGES. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM USING HOUGH LINES STEMS THE EXTRACTION OF VEIN FEATURE FROM THE LEAF IMAGES BY PLOTTING THE LINES OVER THE FIRST DEGREE VEINS. ANGLE OF LINES FROM THE PRIMARY VEIN TO THE SECONDARY VEIN IS CONSIDERED AS THE INPUT PARAMETER FOR PROCESSING THE EXTRACTED VEIN FEATURES. THE CENTROID VEIN ANGLE IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE PRIMARY FEATURE. THE VEIN FEATURE WAS GIVEN AS THE INPUT TO THE NEURAL NETWORK FOR EFFICIENT CLASSIFICATION AND THE RESULTS WERE TESTED WITH 15 SPECIES OF PLANTS TAKEN FROM â€œLEAFILIAâ€ DATA SETS.

"SEELAND M;RZANNY M;BOHO D;WÃ„LDCHEN J;MÃ„DER P";IMAGEBASED CLASSIFICATION OF PLANT GENUS AND FAMILY FOR TRAINED AND UNTRAINED PLANT SPECIES;BACKGROUND: MODERN PLANT TAXONOMY REFLECTS PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS AMONG TAXA BASED ON PROPOSED MORPHOLOGICAL AND GENETIC SIMILARITIES. HOWEVER, TAXONOMICAL RELATION IS NOT NECESSARILY REFLECTED BY CLOSE OVERALL RESEMBLANCE, BUT RATHER BY COMMONALITY OF VERY SPECIFIC MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS OR SIMILARITY ON THE MOLECULAR LEVEL. IT IS AN OPEN RESEARCH QUESTION TO WHICH EXTENT PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONS WITHIN HIGHER TAXONOMIC LEVELS SUCH AS GENERA AND FAMILIES ARE REFLECTED BY SHARED VISUAL CHARACTERS OF THE CONSTITUTING SPECIES. AS A CONSEQUENCE, IT IS EVEN MORE QUESTIONABLE WHETHER THE TAXONOMY OF PLANTS AT THESE LEVELS CAN BE IDENTIFIED FROM IMAGES USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES. RESULTS: WHEREAS PREVIOUS STUDIES ON AUTOMATED PLANT IDENTIFICATION FROM IMAGES FOCUSED ON THE SPECIES LEVEL, WE INVESTIGATED CLASSIFICATION AT HIGHER TAXONOMIC LEVELS SUCH AS GENERA AND FAMILIES. WE USED IMAGES OF 1000 PLANT SPECIES THAT ARE REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE FLORA OF WESTERN EUROPE. WE TESTED HOW ACCURATE A VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF GENERA AND FAMILIES CAN BE LEARNED FROM IMAGES OF THEIR SPECIES IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THE TAXONOMY OF SPECIES INCLUDED IN AND EXCLUDED FROM LEARNING. USING NATURAL IMAGES WITH RANDOM CONTENT, ROUGHLY 500 IMAGES PER SPECIES ARE REQUIRED FOR ACCURATE CLASSIFICATION. THE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY FOR 1000 SPECIES AMOUNTS TO 82.2% AND INCREASES TO 85.9% AND 88.4% ON GENUS AND FAMILY LEVEL. CLASSIFYING SPECIES EXCLUDED FROM TRAINING, THE ACCURACY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES TO 38.3% AND 38.7% ON GENUS AND FAMILY LEVEL. EXCLUDED SPECIES OF WELL REPRESENTED GENERA AND FAMILIES CAN BE CLASSIFIED WITH 67.8% AND 52.8% ACCURACY. CONCLUSION: OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT SHARED VISUAL CHARACTERS ARE INDEED PRESENT AT HIGHER TAXONOMIC LEVELS. MOST DOMINANTLY THEY ARE PRESERVED IN FLOWERS AND LEAVES, AND ENABLE STATE-OF-THE-ART CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS TO LEARN ACCURATE VISUAL REPRESENTATIONS OF PLANT GENERA AND FAMILIES. GIVEN A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT AND COMPOSITION OF TRAINING DATA, WE SHOW THAT THIS ALLOWS FOR HIGH CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY INCREASING WITH THE TAXONOMIC LEVEL AND EVEN FACILITATING THE TAXONOMIC IDENTIFICATION OF SPECIES EXCLUDED FROM THE TRAINING PROCESS.

URBAN TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION AND EVALUATION OF THEIR ROLES IN ATMOSPHERIC CARBON STOCK (CS) ARE STILL AMONG THE PRIME CONCERNS FOR CITY PLANNERS REGARDING INITIATING A CONVENIENT AND EASILY ADAPTIVE URBAN GREEN PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. A DETAILED METHODOLOGY ON THE URBAN TREE CARBON STOCK CALIBRATION AND MAPPING WAS CONDUCTED IN THE URBAN AREA OF BRUSSELS, BELGIUM. A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE MAPPING OUTCOMES WAS ASSESSED TO DEFINE THE CONVENIENCE AND EFFICIENCY OF TWO DIFFERENT REMOTE SENSING DATA SOURCES, LIGHT DETECTION AND RANGING (LIDAR) AND WORLDVIEW-3 (WV-3), IN A UNIQUE URBAN AREA. THE MAPPING RESULTS WERE VALIDATED AGAINST FIELD ESTIMATED CARBON STOCKS. AT THE INITIAL STAGE, DOMINANT TREE SPECIES WERE IDENTIFIED AND CLASSIFIED USING THE HIGH-RESOLUTION WORLDVIEW3 IMAGE, LEADING TO THE FINAL CARBON STOCK MAPPING BASED ON THE DOMINANT SPECIES. AN OBJECT-BASED IMAGE ANALYSIS APPROACH WAS EMPLOYED TO ATTAIN AN OVERALL ACCURACY (OA) OF 71\% DURING THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE DOMINANT SPECIES. THE FIELD ESTIMATIONS OF CARBON STOCK FOR EACH PLOT WERE DONE UTILIZING AN ALLOMETRIC MODEL BASED ON THE FIELD TREE DENDROMETRIC DATA. LATER BASED ON THE CORRELATION AMONG THE FIELD DATA AND THE VARIABLES (I.E., NORMALIZED DIFFERENCE VEGETATION INDEX, NDVI AND CROWN HEIGHT MODEL, CHM) EXTRACTED FROM THE AVAILABLE REMOTE SENSING DATA, THE CARBON STOCK MAPPING AND VALIDATION HAD BEEN DONE IN A GIS ENVIRONMENT. THE CALIBRATED NDVI AND CHM HAD BEEN USED TO COMPUTE POSSIBLE CARBON STOCK IN EITHER CASE OF THE WV-3 IMAGE AND LIDAR DATA, RESPECTIVELY. A COMPARATIVE DISCUSSION HAS BEEN INTRODUCED TO BRING OUT THE ISSUES, ESPECIALLY FOR THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WHERE WV-3 DATA COULD BE A BETTER SOLUTION OVER THE HARDLY AVAILABLE LIDAR DATA.

"CUI L;CHEN S;MU Y;XU X;ZHANG B;ZHAO X";TREE SPECIES CLASSIFICATION OVER CLOUDY MOUNTAINOUS REGIONS BY SPATIOTEMPORAL FUSION AND ENSEMBLE CLASSIFIER;ACCURATE MAPPING OF TREE SPECIES IS CRITICAL FOR THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FORESTRY INDUSTRY. HOWEVER, THE LACK OF CLOUD-FREE OPTICAL IMAGES MAKES IT CHALLENGING TO MAP TREE SPECIES ACCURATELY IN CLOUDY MOUNTAINOUS REGIONS. IN ORDER TO IMPROVE TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLASSIFICATION METHOD USING SPATIOTEMPORAL FUSION AND ENSEMBLE CLASSIFIER IS PROPOSED. THE APPLICABILITY OF THREE SPATIOTEMPORAL FUSION METHODS, I.E., THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL ADAPTIVE REFLECTANCE FUSION MODEL (STARFM), THE FLEXIBLE SPATIOTEMPORAL DATA FUSION (FSDAF), AND THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL NONLOCAL FILTER-BASED FUSION MODEL (STNLFFM), IN FUSING MODIS AND LANDSAT 8 IMAGES WAS INVESTIGATED. THE FUSION RESULTS IN HELONG CITY SHOW THAT THE STNLFFM ALGORITHM GENERATED THE BEST FUSED IMAGES. THE CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS BETWEEN THE FUSION IMAGES AND ACTUAL LANDSAT IMAGES ON MAY 28 AND OCTOBER 19 WERE 0.9746 AND 0.9226, RESPECTIVELY, WITH AN AVERAGE OF 0.9486. DENSE LANDSAT-LIKE TIME SERIES AT 8-DAY TIME INTERVALS WERE GENERATED USING THIS METHOD. THIS TIME SERIES IMAGERY AND TOPOGRAPHY-DERIVED FEATURES WERE USED AS PREDICTOR VARIABLES. FOUR MACHINE LEARNING METHODS, I.E., K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS (KNN), RANDOM FOREST (RF), ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS (ANNS), AND LIGHT GRADIENT BOOSTING MACHINE (LIGHTGBM), WERE SELECTED FOR TREE SPECIES CLASSIFICATION IN HELONG CITY, JILIN PROVINCE. AN ENSEMBLE CLASSIFIER COMBINING THESE CLASSIFIERS WAS CONSTRUCTED TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE ACCURACY. THE ENSEMBLE CLASSIFIER CONSISTENTLY ACHIEVED THE HIGHEST ACCURACY IN ALMOST ALL CLASSIFICATION SCENARIOS, WITH A MAXIMUM OVERALL ACCURACY IMPROVEMENT OF APPROXIMATELY 3.4% COMPARED TO THE BEST BASE CLASSIFIER. COMPARED TO ONLY USING A SINGLE TEMPORAL IMAGE, UTILIZING DENSE TIME SERIES AND THE ENSEMBLE CLASSIFIER CAN IMPROVE THE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY BY ABOUT 20%, AND THE OVERALL ACCURACY REACHES 84.32%. IN CONCLUSION, USING SPATIOTEMPORAL FUSION AND THE ENSEMBLE CLASSIFIER CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION IN CLOUDY MOUNTAINOUS AREAS WITH POOR DATA AVAILABILITY.

A LARGE AMOUNT OF BEHAVIORAL DATA SHOWS THAT BEES ARE PERFECTLY ADEPT AT LEARNING AND EXPLOITING A VARIETY OF SPATIAL CUES IN THE TASK OF RECOGNIZING AND DISCRIMINATING BETWEEN VISUAL STIMULI. THESE CUES INCLUDE SPATIAL FREQUENCY, DISTRIBUTION OF CONTRASTING AREAS, ORIENTATION OF CONTOURS, SIZE AND DISTANCE, DIFFERENT TYPES OF EDGES, AND SYMMETRY (OR, IN A BROADER SENSE, GEOMETRY). SYMMETRY CONSTITUTES A GLOBAL FEATURE THAT IS ONLY ONE OF THE CUES THAT THE TARGET OFFERS. SYMMETRICAL STIMULI ALWAYS CONTAIN SEVERAL FURTHER SPATIAL CUES THAT BECOME RELEVANT AS THE BEE COMES NEARER TO THE STIMULI. THE RESULTS REVIEWED HERE SHOW THAT THE SPATIAL SIGNALS USED BY THE BEE DEPEND ON WHETHER THE STIMULI ARE PRESENTED ON A HORIZONTAL OR A VERTICAL PLANE, ON WHETHER BEES MAKE THEIR CHOICES AT A LESSER OR A GREATER DISTANCE, AND ON WHETHER THE TARGET'S IMAGE IS STATIONARY AT THE LEVEL OF THE EYE, AS OPPOSED TO MOVING. FURTHER, IT IS SHOWN THAT PATTERN RECOGNITION IN THE BEE DOES NOT ALWAYS REQUIRE A LEARNING PROCESS (I.E., SEVERAL TYPES OF RESPONSE TO VISUAL STIMULI ARE BASED ON HARD-WIRED, INNATE BEHAVIORAL PROGRAMS).

"MINOWA Y;KUBOTA Y;NAKATSUKASA S";VERIFICATION OF A DEEP LEARNINGBASED TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION MODEL USING IMAGES OF BROADLEAF AND CONIFEROUS TREE LEAVES;"THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO VERIFY THE ACCURACY OF TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION USING DEEP LEARNING WITH LEAF IMAGES OF BROADLEAF AND CONIFEROUS TREES IN OUTDOOR PHOTOGRAPHS. FOR EACH OF 12 BROADLEAF AND EIGHT CONIFEROUS TREE SPECIES, WE ACQUIRED 300 PHOTOGRAPHS OF LEAVES AND USED THOSE TO PRODUCE 72,000 256 Ã— 256-PIXEL IMAGES. WE USED CAFFE AS THE DEEP LEARNING FRAMEWORK AND ALEXNET AND GOOGLENET AS THE DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS. WE CONSTRUCTED FOUR LEARNING MODELS THAT COMBINED TWO LEARNING PATTERNS: ONE FOR INDIVIDUAL CLASSIFICATION OF 20 SPECIES AND THE OTHER FOR TWO-GROUP CLASSIFICATION (BROADLEAF VS. CONIFEROUS TREES), WITH AND WITHOUT DATA AUGMENTATION, RESPECTIVELY. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED MODEL WAS EVALUATED ACCORDING TO THE MCC AND F-SCORE. BOTH CLASSIFICATION MODELS EXHIBITED VERY HIGH ACCURACY FOR ALL LEARNING PATTERNS; THE HIGHEST MCC WAS 0.997 FOR GOOGLENET WITH DATA AUGMENTATION. THE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY WAS HIGHER FOR BROADLEAF TREES WHEN THE MODEL WAS TRAINED USING BROADLEAF ONLY; FOR CONIFEROUS TREES, THE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY WAS HIGHER WHEN THE MODEL WAS TRAINED USING BOTH TREE TYPES SIMULTANEOUSLY THAN WHEN IT WAS TRAINED USING CONIFEROUS TREES ONLY.

"PARK G;LEE Y;YOON Y;AHN J;LEE J;JANG Y";MACHINE LEARNINGBASED SPECIES CLASSIFICATION METHODS USING DARTTOFMS DATA FOR FIVE CONIFEROUS WOOD SPECIES;VARIOUS PROBLEMS WORLDWIDE ARE CAUSED BY ILLEGAL PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF TIMBER, SUCH AS DECEPTION ABOUT TIMBER SPECIES AND ORIGIN AND ILLEGAL LOGGING. NUMEROUS STUDIES ON WOOD TRACKING ARE BEING CONDUCTED AROUND THE WORLD TO DEMONSTRATE THE LEGITIMACY OF TIMBER. TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION IS THE MOST BASIC ELEMENT OF WOOD TRACKING RESEARCH BECAUSE THE QUALITY OF WOOD VARIES GREATLY FROM SPECIES TO SPECIES AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE BOTANICAL ORIGIN OF COMMERCIALLY DISTRIBUTED WOOD. ALTHOUGH MANY RECENT STUDIES HAVE COMBINED MACHINE LEARNING-BASED CLASSIFICATION METHODS WITH VARIOUS ANALYTICAL METHODS TO IDENTIFY TREE SPECIES, IT IS UNCLEAR WHICH CLASSIFICATION MODEL IS MOST EFFECTIVE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS WORK IS TO EXAMINE AND COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF THREE SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFICATION MODELS, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM), RANDOM FOREST (RF), AND ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK (ANN), IN IDENTIFYING FIVE CONIFER SPECIES AND PROPOSE AN OPTIMAL MODEL. USING DIRECT ANALYSIS IN REAL-TIME IONIZATION COMBINED WITH TIME-OF-FLIGHT MASS SPECTROMETRY (DART-TOF-MS), METABOLIC FINGERPRINTS OF 250 INDIVIDUAL SPECIMENS REPRESENTING FIVE SPECIES WERE COLLECTED THREE TIMES. WHEN THE MACHINE LEARNING MODELS WERE APPLIED TO CLASSIFY THE WOOD SPECIES, ANN OUTPERFORMED SVM AND RF. ALL THREE MODELS SHOWED 100% PREDICTION ACCURACY FOR GENUS CLASSIFICATION. FOR SPECIES CLASSIFICATION, THE ANN MODEL HAD THE HIGHEST PREDICTION ACCURACY OF 98.22%. THE RF MODEL HAD AN ACCURACY OF 94.22%, AND THE SVM HAD THE LOWEST ACCURACY OF 92.89%. THESE FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE THE PRACTICALITY OF AUTHENTICATING WOOD SPECIES BY COMBINING DART-TOF-MS WITH MACHINE LEARNING, AND THEY INDICATE THAT ANN IS THE BEST MODEL FOR WOOD SPECIES IDENTIFICATION.

"SUN X;XU L;ZHOU Y;SHI Y";LEAVES AND TWIGS IMAGE RECOGNITION BASED ON DEEP LEARNING AND COMBINED CLASSIFIER ALGORITHMS;IN RECENT YEARS, THE AUTOMATIC RECOGNITION OF TREE SPECIES BASED ON IMAGES TAKEN BY DIGITAL CAMERAS HAS BEEN WIDELY APPLIED. HOWEVER, MANY PROBLEMS STILL EXIST, SUCH AS INSUFFICIENT TREE SPECIES IMAGE ACQUISITION, UNEVEN DISTRIBUTION OF IMAGE CATEGORIES, AND LOW RECOGNITION ACCURACY. TREE LEAVES CAN BE USED TO DIFFERENTIATE AND CLASSIFY TREE SPECIES DUE TO THEIR COGNITIVE SIGNATURES IN COLOR, VEIN TEXTURE, SHAPE CONTOUR, AND EDGE SERRATION. MOREOVER, THE WAY THE LEAVES ARE ARRANGED ON THE TWIGS HAS STRONG CHARACTERISTICS. IN THIS STUDY, WE FIRST BUILT AN IMAGE DATASET OF 21 TREE SPECIES BASED ON THE FEATURES OF THE TWIGS AND LEAVES. THE TREE SPECIES FEATURE DATASET WAS DIVIDED INTO THE TRAINING SET AND TEST SET, WITH A RATIO OF 8:2. FEATURE EXTRACTION WAS PERFORMED AFTER TRAINING THE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) USING THE K-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION (K-FOLDâ€“CV) METHOD, AND TREE SPECIES CLASSIFICATION WAS PERFORMED WITH CLASSIFIERS. TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION, WE COMBINED THREE IMPROVED CNN MODELS WITH THREE CLASSIFIERS. EVALUATION INDICATORS SHOW THAT THE OVERALL ACCURACY OF THE DESIGNED COMPOSITE MODEL WAS 1.76% TO 9.57% HIGHER THAN OTHER CNN MODELS. FURTHERMORE, IN THE MIXNET XL CNN MODEL, COMBINED WITH THE K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS (KNN) CLASSIFIER, THE HIGHEST OVERALL ACCURACY RATE WAS OBTAINED AT 99.86%. IN THE EXPERIMENT, THE GRAD-CAM HEATMAP WAS USED TO ANALYZE THE DISTRIBUTION OF FEATURE REGIONS THAT PLAY A KEY ROLE IN CLASSIFICATION DECISIONS. OBSERVATION OF THE GRAD-CAM HEATMAP ILLUSTRATED THAT THE MAIN OBSERVATION AREA OF SE-RESNET50 WAS THE MOST ACCURATELY POSITIONED, AND WAS MAINLY CONCENTRATED IN THE INTERIOR OF SMALL TWIGS AND LEAFLETS. OUR RESEARCH SHOWED THAT MODIFYING THE TRAINING METHOD AND CLASSIFICATION MODULE OF THE CNN MODEL AND COMBINING IT WITH TRADITIONAL CLASSIFIERS TO FORM A COMPOSITE MODEL CAN EFFECTIVELY IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF TREE SPECIES RECOGNITION.

"YUAN J;WU Z;LI S;KANG P;ZHU S";MULTIFEATUREBASED IDENTIFICATION OF SUBTROPICAL EVERGREEN TREE SPECIES USING GAOFEN2 IMAGERY AND ALGORITHM COMPARISON;THE SPECIES AND DISTRIBUTION OF TREES IN A FOREST ARE CRITICAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF FOREST ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF FOREST MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. SUBTROPICAL FOREST LANDSCAPES FEATURE A COMPLEX CANOPY STRUCTURE AND HIGH STAND DENSITY. STUDIES ON THE EFFECTS OF CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS ON THE REMOTE SENSING-BASED IDENTIFICATION OF TREE SPECIES ARE FEW. GF-2 IS THE FIRST SATELLITE IN CHINA WITH SUB-METER ACCURACY WHICH HAS THE HIGH RESOLUTION AND SHORT REPLAY CYCLE. HERE, WE CONSIDERED THREE REPRESENTATIVE TREE TYPES (MASSON PINE, CHINESE FIR, AND BROADLEAVED EVERGREEN TREES) IN THE SOUTHERN SUBTROPICAL EVERGREEN BROADLEAVED FOREST REGION OF CHINA AS RESEARCH OBJECTS. WE QUANTITATIVELY COMPARED THE EFFECTS OF FIVE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS, INCLUDING THE BACKPROPAGATION NEURAL NETWORK, K-NEAREST NEIGHBOUR, POLYTOMOUS LOGISTIC REGRESSION, RANDOM FOREST (RF) AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM), AND FOUR FEATURES (VEGETATION INDEX, BAND REFLECTANCE, TEXTURAL FEATURES, AND TOPOGRAPHIC FACTORS) ON TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION USING GAOFEN-2 PANCHROMATIC AND MULTISPECTRAL REMOTE SENSING IMAGES AND FIELD SURVEY DATA. ALL FIVE CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS COULD EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY MAJOR TREE SPECIES IN SUBTROPICAL FOREST AREAS (OVERALL ACCURACY [OA] > 87.40%, KAPPA COEFFICIENT > 81.08%). THE SVM MODEL EXHIBITED THE BEST IDENTIFICATION ABILITY (OA = 90.27%, KAPPA COEFFICIENT = 85.37%), FOLLOWED BY RF (OA = 88.90%, KAPPA COEFFICIENT = 83.30%). THE COMBINATION OF BAND REFLECTANCE, VEGETATION INDEX, AND THE TOPOGRAPHIC FACTOR PERFORMED EXHIBITED THE BEST, FOLLOWED BY THE COMBINATION OF BAND REFLECTANCE, VEGETATION INDEX, TEXTURAL FEATURE, AND TOPOGRAPHIC FACTOR. IN ADDITION, WE FIND THAT THE CLASSIFIER CONSTRUCTED BY A SINGLE FEATURE IS NOT AS EFFECTIVE AS THE COMBINATION OF MULTIPLE FEATURE FACTORS. THE ADDITION OF TOPOGRAPHIC FACTORS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE ABILITY OF TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION. ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS OF THE FIVE CLASSIFIERS, THE SEPARABILITY OF THE THREE TREE SPECIES WAS GOOD. THE PRODUCERâ€™S ACCURACY AND USERâ€™S ACCURACY OF MASSON PINE WERE MORE THAN 90%, AND THE EVERGREEN BROAD-LEAVED TREE AND CHINESE FIR WERE MORE THAN 80%. THE COMMISSION ERRORS AND OMISSION ERRORS OF THE THREE TREE SPECIES WERE EVERGREEN BROADLEAVED TREE > CHINESE FIR > MASSON PINE. THE VARIABLE IMPORTANCE ASSESSMENT RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE NORMALIZED DIFFERENCE GREENNESS INDEX, ALTITUDE, AND THE MODIFIED SOIL-ADJUSTED VEGETATION INDEX WERE THE KEY VARIABLES. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY USED GF-2 TO ACCURATELY IDENTIFY THE MAIN TREE SPECIES OF SUBTROPICAL EVERGREEN FORESTS IN CHINA, WHICH CAN HELP FOREST MANAGERS TO REGULARLY MONITOR TREE SPECIES COMPOSITION AND PROVIDE THEORETICAL SUPPORT FOR FOREST MANAGERS TO FORMULATE POLICIES, MONITOR SUSTAINABLE PLANS FOR WOOD MINING, AND FOREST CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES.

"HUBBLE K;DAUGHTERS K;MANSTEAD A;REES A;THAPAR A;VAN G S";OXYTOCIN REDUCES FACE PROCESSING TIME BUT LEAVES RECOGNITION ACCURACY AND EYEGAZE UNAFFECTED;"OBJECTIVES: PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT OXYTOCIN (OXT) CAN IMPROVE THE RECOGNITION OF EMOTIONAL FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; IT HAS BEEN PROPOSED THAT THIS EFFECT IS MEDIATED BY AN INCREASE IN ATTENTION TO THE EYE-REGION OF FACES. NEVERTHELESS, EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF THIS CLAIM IS INCONSISTENT, AND FEW STUDIES HAVE DIRECTLY TESTED THE EFFECT OF OXYTOCIN ON EMOTION RECOGNITION VIA ALTERED EYE-GAZE METHODS: IN A DOUBLE-BLIND, WITHIN-SUBJECTS, RANDOMIZED CONTROL EXPERIMENT, 40 HEALTHY MALE PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED 24 IU INTRANASAL OXT AND PLACEBO IN TWO IDENTICAL EXPERIMENTAL SESSIONS SEPARATED BY A 2-WEEK INTERVAL. VISUAL ATTENTION TO THE EYE-REGION WAS ASSESSED ON BOTH OCCASIONS WHILE PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A STATIC FACIAL EMOTION RECOGNITION TASK USING MEDIUM INTENSITY FACIAL EXPRESSIONS. RESULTS: ALTHOUGH OXT HAD NO EFFECT ON EMOTION RECOGNITION ACCURACY, RECOGNITION PERFORMANCE WAS IMPROVED BECAUSE FACE PROCESSING WAS FASTER ACROSS EMOTIONS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF OXT. THIS EFFECT WAS MARGINALLY SIGNIFICANT (P<.06). CONSISTENT WITH A PREVIOUS STUDY USING DYNAMIC STIMULI, OXT HAD NO EFFECT ON EYE-GAZE PATTERNS WHEN VIEWING STATIC EMOTIONAL FACES AND THIS WAS NOT RELATED TO RECOGNITION ACCURACY OR FACE PROCESSING TIME. CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT OXT-INDUCED ENHANCED FACIAL EMOTION RECOGNITION IS NOT NECESSARILY MEDIATED BY AN INCREASE IN ATTENTION TO THE EYE-REGION OF FACES, AS PREVIOUSLY ASSUMED. WE DISCUSS SEVERAL METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES WHICH MAY EXPLAIN DISCREPANT FINDINGS AND SUGGEST THE EFFECT OF OXT ON VISUAL ATTENTION MAY DIFFER DEPENDING ON TASK REQUIREMENTS.

"ZHANG R;ZHU Y;GE Z;MU H;QI D;NI H";TRANSFER LEARNING FOR LEAF SMALL DATASET USING IMPROVED RESNET50 NETWORK WITH MIXED ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS;TAXONOMIC STUDIES OF LEAVES ARE ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF CORRECTLY IDENTIFYING PLANT SPECIES. IN THIS PAPER, MIXED ACTIVATION FUNCTION IS USED TO IMPROVE THE RESNET50 NETWORK IN ORDER TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF LEAF RECOGNITION. FIRSTLY, LEAF IMAGES OF 15 COMMON TREE SPECIES IN NORTHERN CHINA WERE COLLECTED FROM THE URBAN FORESTRY DEMONSTRATION BASE OF NORTHEAST FORESTRY UNIVERSITY (45Â°43â€²â€“45Â°44â€² N, 126Â°37â€²â€“126Â°38â€² E, FOREST TYPE WAS ARTIFICIAL FOREST), AND A SMALL LEAF DATASET WAS ESTABLISHED. AFTER THAT, SEVEN COMMONLY USED ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS WERE SELECTED TO IMPROVE THE RESNET50 NETWORK STRUCTURE, AND THE IMPROVED NETWORK WAS APPLIED TO THE TRANSFER LEARNING RESEARCH OF THE LEAF SMALL DATASET. ON THIS BASIS, FIVE ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS WITH BETTER PERFORMANCE WERE SELECTED FOR THE STUDY OF MIXED ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS IN DEEP LEARNING. TWO OF THESE FIVE ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS ARE ARBITRARILY SELECTED FOR COMBINATION, AND A TOTAL OF TWENTY COMBINATIONS ARE OBTAINED. FURTHER, THE FIRST ACTIVATION FUNCTION WAS USED IN EACH COMBINATION TO REPLACE THE FIRST RELU FUNCTION AFTER ALL ADDITION OPERATIONS IN THE RESNET50 NETWORK RESIDUAL BLOCK STRUCTURE, AND ANOTHER ACTIVATION FUNCTION WAS USED TO REPLACE THE OTHER POSITION RELU FUNCTIONS. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT IN THE TRANSFER LEARNING OF THE LEAF SMALL DATASET USING THE RESNET50 DEEP RESIDUAL NETWORK, THE APPROPRIATE COMBINATION OF MIXED ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS CAN INCREASE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE IMPROVED NETWORK TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. AMONG THEM, THE ELU-SWISH1 COMBINATION HAS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT EFFECT ON THE NETWORK PERFORMANCE, WHOSE FINAL EFFECTIVE VALIDATION ACCURACY REACHES 98.17%. FURTHERMORE, THE COMPARISON WITH GOOGLENET AND VGG-16 ALSO DEMONSTRATES THE EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE OF THE IMPROVED ELU-SWISH1 RESNET50 (ES-RESNET50) NETWORK ARCHITECTURE. FINALLY, TESTS ON THE OTHER TWO SMALL LEAF DATASETS, FLAVIA AND SWEDISH, ALSO DEMONSTRATE THE PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT OF ES-RESNET50. THE VALIDATION ACCURACY OF THE IMPROVED ES-RESNET 50 ALGORITHM ON THESE TWO DATASETS REACHES 99.30% AND 99.39%, RESPECTIVELY. ALL THESE EXPERIMENTS PROVE THAT THE RECOGNITION PERFORMANCE OF LEAF TRANSFER LEARNING USING THE ES-RESNET50 NETWORK IS INDEED IMPROVED, WHICH MAY BE CAUSED BY THE COMPLEMENTARITY OF THE E-EXPONENTIAL GRADIENT OF ELU AND SWISH1 ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS IN THE NEGATIVE REGION.

"CHEN X;MAO Y;MA X;QI L";A TACTILE METHOD FOR RICE PLANT RECOGNITION BASED ON MACHINE LEARNING;ACCURATE AND REAL-TIME RECOGNITION OF RICE PLANTS IS THE PREMISE UNDERLYING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PRECISE WEED CONTROL. HOWEVER, ACHIEVING DESIRED RESULTS IN PADDY FIELDS USING THE TRADITIONAL VISUAL METHOD IS DIFFICULT DUE TO THE OCCLUSION OF RICE LEAVES AND THE INTERFERENCE OF WEEDS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEVELOP A NOVEL RICE PLANT RECOGNITION SENSOR BASED ON A TACTILE METHOD WHICH ACQUIRES TACTILE INFORMATION THROUGH PHYSICAL TOUCH. THE TACTILE SENSOR WOULD BE MOUNTED ON THE PADDY FIELD WEEDER TO PROVIDE IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION FOR THE ACTUATOR. FIRST, A FLEXIBLE GASBAG FILLED WITH AIR WAS DEVELOPED, WHERE VIBRATION FEATURES PRODUCED BY TACTILE AND SLIDING FEEDBACK WERE ACQUIRED WHEN THIS APPARATUS TOUCHED RICE PLANTS OR WEEDS, ALLOWING THE SUBTLE VIBRATION DATA WITH IDENTIFICATION FEATURES TO BE REFLECTED THROUGH THE VOLTAGE VALUE OF AN AIR-PRESSURED SENSOR MOUNTED INSIDE THE GASBAG. SECOND, VOLTAGE DATA WERE PREPROCESSED BY THREE ALGORITHMS TO OPTIMIZE RECOGNITION FEATURES, INCLUDING DIMENSIONAL FEATURE, DIMENSIONLESS FEATURE, AND FRACTAL DIMENSION. THE THREE TYPES OF FEATURES WERE USED TO TRAIN AND TEST A NEURAL NETWORK CLASSIFIER. TO MAXIMIZE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY, AN OPTIMUM SET OF FEATURES (B (VARIANCE), F (KURTOSIS), H (WAVEFORM FACTOR), L (BOX DIMENSION), AND M (HURST EXPONENT)) WERE SELECTED USING A GENETIC ALGORITHM. FINALLY, THE FEATURE-OPTIMIZED CLASSIFIER WAS TRAINED, AND THE ACTUAL PERFORMANCES OF THE SENSOR AT DIFFERENT CONTACT POSITIONS WERE TESTED. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE RECOGNITION RATES OF THE END, MIDDLE, AND ROOT OF THE SENSOR WERE 90.67%, 98%, AND 96% RESPECTIVELY.

"HU J;CHEN Z;YANG M;ZHANG R;CUI Y";A MULTISCALE FUSION CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK FOR PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION;PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION IS A COMPUTER VISION TASK USED TO AUTOMATICALLY RECOGNIZE PLANT SPECIES. IT IS VERY CHALLENGING SINCE RICH PLANT LEAF MORPHOLOGICAL VARIATIONS, SUCH AS SIZES, TEXTURES, SHAPES, VENATION, AND SO ON. MOST EXISTING PLANT LEAF METHODS TYPICALLY NORMALIZE ALL PLANT LEAF IMAGES TO THE SAME SIZE AND RECOGNIZE THEM AT ONE SCALE, RESULTING IN UNSATISFACTORY PERFORMANCES. IN THIS LETTER, A MULTISCALE FUSION CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (MSF-CNN) IS PROPOSED FOR PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION AT MULTIPLE SCALES. FIRST, AN INPUT IMAGE IS DOWN-SAMPLED INTO MULTIPLES LOW RESOLUTION IMAGES WITH A LIST OF BILINEAR INTERPOLATION OPERATIONS. THEN, THESE INPUT IMAGES WITH DIFFERENT SCALES ARE STEP-BY-STEP FED INTO THE MSF-CNN ARCHITECTURE TO LEARN DISCRIMINATIVE FEATURES AT DIFFERENT DEPTHS. AT THIS STAGE, THE FEATURE FUSION BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT SCALES IS REALIZED BY A CONCATENATION OPERATION, WHICH CONCATENATES FEATURE MAPS LEARNED ON DIFFERENT SCALE IMAGES FROM A CHANNEL VIEW. ALONG WITH THE DEPTH OF THE MSF-CNN, MULTISCALE IMAGES ARE PROGRESSIVELY HANDLED AND THE CORRESPONDING FEATURES ARE FUSED. THIRD, THE LAST LAYER OF THE MSF-CNN AGGREGATES ALL DISCRIMINATIVE INFORMATION TO OBTAIN THE FINAL FEATURE FOR PREDICTING THE PLANT SPECIES OF THE INPUT IMAGE. EXPERIMENTS SHOW THE PROPOSED MSF-CNN METHOD IS SUPERIOR TO MULTIPLE STATE-OF-THE ART PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION METHODS ON THE MALAYAKEW LEAF DATASET AND THE LEAFSNAP PLANT LEAF DATASET.

HERE WE REPORT ON THE USE OF MACHINE LEARNING TO TRAIN A NEURAL NETWORK TO IDENTIFY AND ISOLATE RED CLOVER PLANTS FROM DIGITAL IMAGES OF SPACE PLANTED RED CLOVER NURSERIES. CHALLENGES TO RED CLOVER PLANT IDENTIFICATION INCLUDED: 1) PLANTS WERE GROWN WITH A GRASS COMPANION; AND 2) PLANTS WERE CLOSE ENOUGH TO EACH OTHER SO THAT PLANTS OFTEN OVERLAPPED EACH OTHER IN THE DIGITAL IMAGES. TO ESTIMATE BIOMASS YIELD A SECOND NEURAL NETWORK WAS TRAINED USING MACHINE LEARNING TO COUNT LEAVES PER PLANT AMONG IDENTIFIED RED CLOVER PLANTS FROM THE PLANT CLASSIFICATION NEURAL NETWORK. THE TWO NEURAL NETWORKS WERE VALIDATED ON SIX RED CLOVER DIGITAL IMAGE SETS TAKEN ON RED CLOVER SPACE PLANT NURSERIES. AVERAGE NEURAL NETWORK PLANT CLASSIFICATION SUCCESS RATES WERE MEASURED AT 94.6% ACROSS THE SIX DIGITAL IMAGE SETS. NEURAL NETWORK RED CLOVER LEAF COUNTS WERE CORRELATED WITH HUMAN VISUAL BIOMASS SCORES AT R2Â =Â 0.528.

WE FIRST APPLY THE U-NET MODEL TO SEGMENT LEAF IMAGES FROM THE BACKGROUND TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE RECOGNITION SYSTEM. THEN, WE INTRODUCE A MULTIMODEL APPROACH BASED ON A COMBINATION OF LOSS FUNCTIONS FROM THE EFFICIENTNET AND MOBILENET (CALLED AS MULTIMODEL CNN (MMCNN)) TO GENERALIZE A MULTILOSS FUNCTION. THE JOINT LEARNING MULTILOSS MODEL DESIGNED FOR LEAF RECOGNITION ALLOWS EACH NETWORK TO PERFORM ITS TASK AND COOPERATE WITH THE OTHERS SIMULTANEOUSLY, WHERE KNOWLEDGE FROM VARIOUS TRAINED DEEP NETWORKS IS SHARED. THIS COOPERATION-PROPOSED MULTIMODEL IS FORCED TO DEAL WITH MORE COMPLICATED PROBLEMS RATHER THAN A SIMPLE CLASSIFICATION. THEREFORE, THE NETWORK CAN LEARN MUCH RICH INFORMATION AND IMPROVE ITS GENERALIZATION CAPABILITY. FURTHERMORE, A MULTILOSS TRADE-OFF STRATEGY BETWEEN TWO DEEP LEARNING MODELS CAN REDUCE THE EFFECT OF REDUNDANCY PROBLEMS IN ENSEMBLE CLASSIFIERS.

THEY HELP IN NOURISHING THE ATMOSPHERE WITH DIVERSE ELEMENTS. PLANTS ARE ALSO A SUBSTANTIAL ELEMENT IN REGULATING CARBON EMISSION AND CLIMATE CHANGE. BUT IN THE PAST, WE HAVE DESTROYED THEM WITHOUT HESITATION. FOR THE REASON THAT NOT ONLY WE HAVE LOST A NUMBER OF SPECIES LOCATED IN THEM, BUT ALSO A SEVERE RESULT HAS ALSO BEEN ENCOUNTERED IN THE FORM OF CLIMATE CHANGE. HOWEVER, IF WE CHOOSE TO GIVE THEM TIME AND SPACE, PLANTS HAVE AN ASTONISHING ABILITY TO RECOVER AND RE-CLOTH THE EARTH WITH VARIED PLANTS AND SPECIES THAT WE HAVE, SO RECENTLY, STORMED. THEREFORE, A CONTRIBUTION HAS BEEN MADE IN THIS ARTICLE TOWARDS THE STUDY OF PLANT GROWTH AND ITS MANAGEMENT. TWELVE ECONOMICALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY BENEFICIAL PLANTS HAVE BEEN SELECTED FOR THIS PURPOSE. LEAF IMAGES OF THESE PLANTS IN HEALTHY AND UNHEALTHY CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED AND ALIENATED AMONG TWO SEPARATE CLASSES. WE HAVE COLLECTED ABOUT 4503 IMAGES OF WHICH CONTAIN 2278 IMAGES OF HEALTHY LEAF AND 2225 IMAGES OF THE DISEASED LEAF. FURTHER, WE HOPE THAT THIS STUDY CAN BE BENEFICIAL FOR RESEARCHERS AND ACADEMICIANS IN DEVELOPING METHODS FOR PLANT IDENTIFICATION, PLANT CLASSIFICATION, PLANT GROWTH MONITORING, LEAF DISEASE DIAGNOSIS, ETC.

MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS ARE USUALLY USED IN VISIBLE LIGHT IMAGE-BASED STUDIES, WHEREAS, IN THERMAL IMAGE-BASED STUDIES, ACQUIRED THERMAL IMAGES TEND TO BE ANALYZED WITH A NAKED EYE VISUAL EXAMINATION. HOWEVER, VISIBLE LIGHT CAMERAS ARE SENSITIVE TO LIGHT, AND CANNOT BE USED IN ENVIRONMENTS WITH LOW ILLUMINATION. ALTHOUGH THERMAL CAMERAS ARE NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO THESE DRAWBACKS, THEY ARE SENSITIVE TO ATMOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY.

THEREFORE, IN THIS STUDY, WE CONDUCTED A NOVEL STUDY BY SIMULTANEOUSLY USING THERMAL IMAGES AND CORRESPONDING VISIBLE LIGHT IMAGES OF PLANTS TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS. THE PROPOSED NETWORK EXTRACTED FEATURES FROM EACH THERMAL IMAGE AND CORRESPONDING VISIBLE LIGHT IMAGE OF PLANTS THROUGH RESIDUAL BLOCK-BASED BRANCH NETWORKS, AND COMBINED THE FEATURES TO INCREASE THE ACCURACY OF THE MULTICLASS CLASSIFICATION.

THE CHALLENGE'S GOAL WAS TO IDENTIFY PLANT SPECIES BASED ON THE TEST SET MADE FROM ONLY PLANT IMAGES IN THE FIELD, GIVEN A TRAINING DATASET CONSISTING OF PRIMARILY HERBARIUM IMAGES. WE IMPLEMENTED A TWO-STREAMED HERBARIUM-FIELD TRIPLET LOSS NETWORK TO EVALUATE THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN HERBARIUM AND FIELD PAIRS, THEREBY MATCHING SPECIES FROM BOTH HERBARIUM AND FIELD DOMAINS. THE NETWORK IS MADE FROM TWO CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS TAKING HERBARIUM AND FIELD IMAGES AS INPUT, RESPECTIVELY. THE NETWORK EMPLOYED IS A SIMILAR BUT IMPROVED VERSION OF OUR SUBMISSION TO THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S CHALLENGE [1]. IN ADDITION, WE TRAINED A ONE-STREAMED NETWORK TAKING BOTH HERBARIUM AND FIELD IMAGES AS INPUT TO ENABLE THE LEARNING OF THE FEATURES OF EACH SPECIES IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR DOMAINS. WE FOUND THAT AN ENSEMBLE OF THESE NETWORKS PERFORMED BETTER THAN THE HERBARIUM-FIELD TRIPLET LOSS NETWORK ALONE.

"BROWN R;NOBLE S";SITESPECIFIC WEED MANAGEMENT SENSING REQUIREMENTS WHAT DO WE NEED TO SEE;AUTOMATED DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION OF WEEDS IN CROP FIELDS IS THE GREATEST OBSTACLE TO DEVELOPMENT OF PRACTICAL SITE-SPECIFIC WEED MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. RESEARCH PROGRESS IS SUMMARIZED FOR TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO THE PROBLEM, REMOTE SENSING WEED MAPPING AND GROUND-BASED DETECTION USING DIGITAL CAMERAS OR NONIMAGING SENSORS. THE GENERAL SPECTRAL AND SPATIAL LIMITATIONS REPORTED FOR EACH TYPE OF WEED IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM ARE REVIEWED. AIRBORNE REMOTE SENSING HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL FOR DETECTION OF DISTINCT WEED PATCHES WHEN THE PATCHES ARE DENSE AND UNIFORM AND HAVE UNIQUE SPECTRAL CHARACTERISTICS. IDENTIFICATION OF WEEDS IS HAMPERED BY SPECTRAL MIXING IN THE RELATIVELY LARGE PIXELS (TYPICALLY LARGER THAN 1 BY 1 M) AND WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE FROM IMAGERY WHERE WEED SEEDLINGS ARE SPARSELY DISTRIBUTED AMONG CROP PLANTS. THE USE OF MULTISPECTRAL IMAGING SENSORS SUCH AS COLOR DIGITAL CAMERAS ON A GROUND-BASED MOBILE PLATFORM SHOWS MORE PROMISE FOR WEED IDENTIFICATION IN FIELD CROPS. SPECTRAL FEATURES PLUS SPATIAL FEATURES SUCH AS LEAF SHAPE AND TEXTURE AND PLANT ORGANIZATION MAY BE EXTRACTED FROM THESE IMAGES.

FRUIT IDENTIFICATION AND ITS FAMILY CLASSIFICATION IS AMONG ONE OF THE AREAS THAT NEEDS MORE EMPHASIS FOR THE SAKE OF AUTOMATION. WITH THIS INSPIRATION, FRUIT IMAGES FOR 52 SPECIES BELONGING TO FOUR DIFFERENT FAMILIES (APIACEAE, BRASSICACEAE, ASTERACEAE, AND APOCYNACEAE) HAVE BEEN USED IN THIS STUDY TO BUILD A DEEP LEARNING ANALYSIS DATASET. FURTHER, THE DATASET HAS BEEN AUGMENTED TO 3800 IMAGES, DIVIDED TO 2660 IMAGES FOR TRAINING AND 1440 FOR TESTING, AND DIFFERENT 14 FRUIT IMAGES BELONGING TO THE SAME FAMILIES HAVE BEEN USED FOR PREDICTION OF THE TESTING MODULE. A NOVEL CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) MODEL ARCHITECTURE HAS BEEN PROPOSED TO EXTRACT THE FRUIT FEATURES, CLASSIFY EACH IMAGE WITH ITS FAMILY, AND USE THE TRAINED MODEL TO PREDICT THAT THE NEW FRUITS BELONG TO THE SAME FOUR FAMILIES. THE MAXIMUM ACCURACY OBTAINED FOR THE TRAINING AND TESTING MODULE WAS 99.82%. THE PREDICTION FOR THIS MODULE SUCCEEDED BY 93% SINCE ALL FRUITSâ€™ SUCCESS PREDICTED WAS ATTAINED EXCEPT ONE FROM THE FAMILY NUMBER 2 (BRASSICACEAE).

RADIAL PARTITIONING, WHICH IS A STRATEGY FOR PRESERVING SPATIAL INFORMATION FROM PITH TO BARK, FURTHER IMPROVES THE PERFORMANCE, ESPECIALLY FOR RADIAL-POROUS SPECIES. THE PEARSON CORRELATION AND AUTOCORRELATION COEFFICIENTS PRODUCED FROM RADIALLY PARTITIONED SUB-IMAGES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE USED AS AUXILIARIES IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF MULTI-FEATURE DATASETS. THE CONTRIBUTION OF IMAGE PARTITIONING STRATEGIES IS FOUND TO BE LIMITED TO SPECIES RECOGNITION AND IS UNREMARKABLE AT THE GENUS LEVEL.

"WANG Z;CUI J;ZHU Y";PLANT RECOGNITION BASED ON JACCARD DISTANCE AND BOW;PLANT RECOGNITION IS A MEANINGFUL RESEARCH THAT HAS ATTRACTED MANY RESEARCHERS. DUE TO THE VARIETY OF PLANTS, IT IS DIFFICULT FOR THE EXISTING IDENTIFICATION METHODS TO IDENTIFY THEIR SPECIES EFFICIENTLY. WE PROPOSES A PLANT RECOGNITION METHOD BASED ON JACCARD DISTANCE AND BAG OF WORDS (BOW). FIRSTLY, JACCARD DISTANCE IS EMPLOYED TO CALCULATE THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TEST SAMPLE AND PART OF THE TRAINING SAMPLES OF ALL SPECIES, C1 SPECIES WITH THE HIGHEST SIMILARITY ARE SELECTED AS CANDIDATE SPECIES OF THE TEST IMAGE, WHICH NOT ONLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF COMPUTATION BUT ALSO SHORTEN THE TIME CONSUMPTION. SECONDLY, BOW IS EMPLOYED TO EXTRACT FEATURES FROM TEXTURE IMAGE AND CONTOUR IMAGE, AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE IS USED FOR TRAINING AND CLASSIFICATION. IN OUR METHOD, THE TEXTURE AND CONTOUR FEATURES OF LEAF IMAGES ARE EXTRACTED BY LAWS TEXTURE MEASURE AND SOBEL OPERATORS RESPECTIVELY. THE LOCAL AND GLOBAL FEATURES OF THE LEAF CAN BE DESCRIBED WELL. SOME REPRESENTATIVE DATASETS ARE USED TO EVALUATE THE PROPOSED METHOD AND OBTAIN HIGH ACCURACY. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS PROVES THAT THE PROPOSED METHOD NOT ONLY HAS A HIGH ACCURACY, BUT ALSO HAS ROBUSTNESS IN NOISE ENVIRONMENT.

"BATCHULUUN G;NAM S;PARK K";DEEP LEARNINGBASED PLANTIMAGE CLASSIFICATION USING A SMALL TRAINING DATASET;EXTENSIVE RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED ON IMAGE AUGMENTATION, SEGMENTATION, DETECTION, AND CLASSIFICATION BASED ON PLANT IMAGES. SPECIFICALLY, PREVIOUS STUDIES ON PLANT IMAGE CLASSIFICATION HAVE USED VARIOUS PLANT DATASETS (FRUITS, VEGETABLES, FLOWERS, TREES, ETC., AND THEIR LEAVES). HOWEVER, EXISTING PLANT-BASED IMAGE DATASETS ARE GENERALLY SMALL. FURTHERMORE, THERE ARE LIMITATIONS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF LARGE-SCALE DATASETS. CONSEQUENTLY, PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON PLANT CLASSIFICATION USING SMALL TRAINING DATASETS ENCOUNTERED DIFFICULTIES IN ACHIEVING HIGH ACCURACY. HOWEVER, RESEARCH ON PLANT IMAGE CLASSIFICATION BASED ON SMALL TRAINING DATASETS IS INSUFFICIENT. ACCORDINGLY, THIS STUDY PERFORMED CLASSIFICATION BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF TRAINING IMAGES OF PLANT-IMAGE DATASETS BY 70%, 50%, 30%, AND 10%, RESPECTIVELY. THEN, THE NUMBER OF IMAGES WAS INCREASED BACK THROUGH AUGMENTATION METHODS FOR TRAINING. THIS ULTIMATELY IMPROVED THE PLANT-IMAGE CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE. BASED ON THE RESPECTIVE PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS, THIS STUDY PROPOSED A PLANT-IMAGE CLASSIFICATION CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (PI-CNN) BASED ON PLANT IMAGE AUGMENTATION USING A PLANT-IMAGE GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORK (PI-GAN).

THE DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS ARE USUALLY APPLIED IN THE VARIOUS AREAS LIKE IMAGES TO BE CLASSIFIED OR IDENTIFIED MORE ACCURATELY. ONE OF THE APPLICATION AREAS OF DEEP LEARNING IS THE PLANT IDENTIFICATION THROUGH ITS LEAF WHICH HELPS TO RECOGNIZE PLANT SPECIES. BOTANISTS CONSUME MOST OF TIME IN IDENTIFYING PLANT SPECIES BY MANUALLY SCRUTINIZING AND FINDING ITS FEATURES. THIS PAPER PROPOSES AN AUTOMATED PLANT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM, FOR IDENTIFYING THE PLANTS SPECIES THROUGH THEIR LEAF. THIS TASK IS ACCOMPLISHED USING DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK TO ACHIEVE HIGHER ACCURACY. IMAGE PRE-PROCESSING, FEATURE EXTRACTION AND RECOGNITION ARE THREE MAIN IDENTIFICATION STEPS WHICH ARE TAKEN UNDER CONSIDERATION. PROPOSED CNN CLASSIFIER LEARNS THE FEATURES OF PLANTS SUCH AS CLASSIFICATION OF LEAFS BY USING HIDDEN LAYERS LIKE CONVOLUTIONAL LAYER, MAX POOLING LAYER, DROPOUT LAYERS AND FULLY CONNECTED LAYERS. THE MODEL ACQUIRES A KNOWLEDGE RELATED TO FEATURES OF SWEDISH LEAF DATASET IN WHICH 15 TREE CLASSES ARE AVAILABLE, THAT HELPS TO PREDICT THE CORRECT CATEGORY OF UNKNOWN PLANT WITH ACCURACY OF 97% AND MINIMUM LOSSES.

ALTHOUGH THIS PIPELINE CAN BE APPLIED TO MANY RECOGNITION TASKS, HOWEVER, THESE APPROACHES HAVE NOT EXPLORED STRUCTURAL CUES OF THE FLOWERS DUE TO THE LARGE VARIATION IN THEIR APPEARANCES.

THUS, PLANT SPECIES CLASSIFICATION IS CRUCIAL TO ADDRESS THIS ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGE. IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN A CONSIDERABLE INCREASE IN STUDIES RELATED TO PLANT TAXONOMY. WHILE SOME RESEARCHERS TRY TO IMPROVE THEIR RECOGNITION PERFORMANCE USING NOVEL APPROACHES, OTHERS CONCENTRATE ON COMPUTATIONAL OPTIMIZATION FOR THEIR FRAMEWORK. IN ADDITION, A FEW STUDIES ARE DIVING INTO FEATURE EXTRACTION TO GAIN SIGNIFICANTLY IN TERMS OF ACCURACY. THIS PAPER PROPOSES AN EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR THE LEAF RECOGNITION PROBLEM. IN OUR PROPOSED APPROACH, A LEAF GOES THROUGH SOME PRE-PROCESSING TO EXTRACT ITS REFINED COLOR IMAGE, VEIN IMAGE, XY-PROJECTION HISTOGRAM, HANDCRAFTED SHAPE, TEXTURE FEATURES, AND FOURIER DESCRIPTORS. THESE ATTRIBUTES ARE THEN TRANSFORMED INTO A BETTER REPRESENTATION BY NEURAL NETWORK-BASED ENCODERS BEFORE A SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) MODEL IS UTILIZED TO CLASSIFY DIFFERENT LEAVES. OVERALL, OUR APPROACH PERFORMS A STATE-OF-THE-ART RESULT ON THE FLAVIA LEAF DATASET, ACHIEVING THE ACCURACY OF 99.69% ON TEST SETS UNDER RANDOM 10-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION AND BYPASSING THE PREVIOUS METHODS.

THEREFORE, TO ANALYZE AND IDENTIFY MEDICINAL LEAVES THROUGH AN ARTIFICIAL EYE OF BOTANISTS, IT WAS EMPHASIZED THAT THE LEAF IMAGE FEATURES SHOULD REMAIN PRESERVED TILL THE FINAL STAGE OF CLASSIFICATION FOR BETTER ACCURACY. THE EXISTING PLANT IDENTIFICATION APPROACHES ARE TRAINED USING THE LEAF IMAGES. SO LEAF FEATURES ARE LOST IN THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE CONVOLUTION PROCESS AND THE SAME FEATURE VALUES ARE GENERATED FOR SIMILAR TYPE LEAF IMAGES. THIS RAISES AMBIGUITY IN THE RESULTS AND AFFECTS THE ACCURACY OF LEAF IMAGE IDENTIFICATION.

MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES ARE IDENTIFIED TO RECOGNIZE A PLANT LEAF. HERE, MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES OF MEDICINAL PLANT LEAVES, VENATION, SHAPES, APICES, AND BASES ARE EXTRACTED AND ANALYZED TO PREDICT THE IMAGE CLASS. SO, THE LEAF FEATURES REMAIN PERSEVERED UNTIL THE FINAL STAGE. THE PROPOSED FEATURE RECOGNITION ANALYSIS IMPROVES THE ACCURACY OF THE LEAF IDENTIFICATION METHOD.

RAW SPECTRA, SIGNIFICANT WAVEBANDS OBTAINED WITH THE RELIEF ALGORITHM AND VARIOUS STATISTICAL FEATURES EXTRACTED FROM RAW SPECTRA WERE USED TO CLASSIFY HEALTHY AND INFECTED PLANTS USING THREE DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS (CAS): DECISION TREE, CUBIC SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE AND K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR MODELS. AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE DISEASE, THE SPECTRAL BANDS SUCH AS 508, 711, 540, 717, 536, 644Â NM AND 705, 1883, 525, 518, 444, 522Â NM WERE THE MOST EFFECTIVE IN DISTINGUISHING FORL AND F.S.-INOCULATED PLANTS FROM HEALTHY PLANTS, RESPECTIVELY. WHILE FORL CAUSED GENERAL STRESS IN THE PLANTS, F.S. ALSO HAD A NEGATIVE PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECT. ALL CAS PROVED HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL IN DISTINGUISHING HEALTHY AND DISEASED PLANTS, WITH MAXIMUM CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY ACHIEVED AS EARLY AS 3 DAI. CAS USING STATISTICAL PARAMETERS AS INPUT HAD HIGHER ACCURACIES THAN OTHER CAS. HEALTHY AND DISEASED PLANT CLASSIFICATION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT CAS (P < 0.05), WHILE DAI, PATHOGEN TYPE AND INPUTS OF THE CLASSIFICATION DID NOT EXHIBIT SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN CLASSIFICATION (P > 0.05) ACCORDING TO ANOVA.

THE SEGMENTATION OF THE PLANT FROM THE BACKGROUND IS KEY TO PLANT RECOGNITION. THE WORK PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER IS A REAL-TIME SEGMENTATION ALGORITHM THAT WAS DEVELOPED TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PLANT SEGMENTATION UNDER NATURAL OUTDOOR LIGHT CONDITIONS. THE PLANT IMAGES WERE GREYED WITH THE COLOUR FEATURES H, A*, 13 AND CR RESPECTIVELY, AND THE PLANT WAS SEGMENTED FROM THE GREY IMAGES WITH A THRESHOLD THAT WAS COMPUTED BY AN ITERATIVE METHOD. EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT SEGMENTATION WAS GENERALLY OF GOOD QUALITY IF THE BACKGROUND WAS BARE SOIL. THE QUALITY OF SEGMENTATION DECLINES IF THE IMAGES ARE GREYED BY H AND CR, AND THE QUALITY REMAINS STABLE IF THEY ARE GREYED BY A* AND I3 WHEN THE BACKGROUND IS COMPLICATED, AND, ESPECIALLY WITH HEAVY SHADOWS. WITH RESPECT TO SEGMENTATION SPEED, THAT GREYED BY CR WAS THE FASTEST AND THAT GREYED BY A* WAS SLOWEST AMONGST THE FOUR.

IN THE PLANT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM, THE CONVENTIONAL METHOD IS TIME-CONSUMING AND NEEDS TO APPLY EXPENSIVE ANALYTICAL INSTRUMENTS. THE AUTOMATED PLANT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM HELPS TO PREDICT PLANT CLASSES EASILY. THE MOST CHALLENGING PART OF THE AUTOMATED PLANT CLASSIFICATION RESEARCH IS TO EXTRACT UNIQUE FEATURES OF LEAVES. THIS PAPER PROPOSES A PLANT CLASSIFICATION MODEL USING AN OPTIMAL FEATURE SET WITH COMBINED FEATURES. THE PROPOSED MODEL IS USED TO EXTRACT FEATURES FROM LEAF IMAGES AND APPLIED TO IMAGE CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS. AFTER THE EVALUATION PROCESS, IT IS FOUND THAT GIST, LOCAL BINARY PATTERN AND PYRAMID HISTOGRAM ORIENTED GRADIENT HAVE BETTER RESULTS THAN OTHERS IN THIS PARTICULAR APPLICATION. COMBINED THESE THREE FEATURES EXTRACTION TECHNIQUES AND SELECTED THE OPTIMAL FEATURE SET THROUGH NEIGHBOURHOOD COMPONENT ANALYSIS. THE OPTIMAL FEATURE SET HELPS CLASSIFY PLANTS WITH MAXIMUM ACCURACY IN MINIMAL TIME.

THIS APPLICATION FIELD HAS SO FAR RECEIVED LESS ATTENTION RATHER THAN THE OTHER IMAGE PROCESSING APPLICATIONS DOMAINS. THIS IS CALLED THE PLANT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM. IN THE PLANT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM, THE CONVENTIONAL TECHNIQUE IS DEALT WITH LOOKING AT THE LEAVES AND FRUITS OF THE PLANTS. HOWEVER, IT DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AS A COST EFFECTIVE APPROACH BECAUSE OF ITS TIME CONSUMPTION. THE IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUE CAN LEAD TO IDENTIFY THE SPECIMENS MORE QUICKLY AND CLASSIFY THEM THROUGH A VISUAL MACHINE METHOD. THIS PAPER PROPOSES A METHODOLOGY FOR IDENTIFYING THE PLANT LEAF IMAGES THROUGH SEVERAL ITEMS INCLUDING GIST AND LOCAL BINARY PATTERN (LBP) FEATURES, THREE KINDS OF GEOMETRIC FEATURES, AS WELL AS COLOR MOMENTS, VEIN FEATURES, AND TEXTURE FEATURES BASED ON LACUNARITY. AFTER COMPLETION OF THE PROCESSING PHASE, THE FEATURES ARE NORMALIZED, AND THEN PBEST-GUIDE BINARY PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION (PBPSO) IS DEVELOPED AS A NOVEL METHOD FOR REDUCTION OF THE FEATURES.

APPLE LEAF DISEASE RECOGNITION BASED ON LEAF IMAGE IS AN ESSENTIAL RESEARCH TOPIC IN THE FIELD OF COMPUTER VISION, WHERE THE KEY TASK IS TO FIND AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO REPRESENT THE DISEASED LEAF IMAGES. IN THIS RESEARCH, BASED ON IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES AND PATTERN RECOGNITION METHODS, AN APPLE LEAF DISEASE RECOGNITION METHOD WAS PROPOSED. A COLOR TRANSFORMATION STRUCTURE FOR THE INPUT RGB (RED, GREEN AND BLUE) IMAGE WAS DESIGNED FIRSTLY AND THEN RGB MODEL WAS CONVERTED TO HSI (HUE, SATURATION AND INTENSITY), YUV AND GRAY MODELS.

EVERY PLANT IS MEDICINE IN ONE OR ANOTHER WAY, BUT AYURVEDA EXPLAINS THE USES OF PLANT-BASED MEDICINES AND IMMUNITY BOOSTERS FOR SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS OF THE HUMAN BODY. TO HELP AYURVEDA, BOTANISTS ARE TRYING TO IDENTIFY MORE SPECIES OF MEDICINAL IMMUNITY-BOOSTING PLANTS BY EVALUATING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LEAF. FOR A NORMAL PERSON, DETECTING IMMUNITY-BOOSTING PLANTS IS A DIFFICULT TASK. DEEP LEARNING NETWORKS PROVIDE HIGHLY ACCURATE RESULTS IN IMAGE PROCESSING. IN THE MEDICINAL PLANT ANALYSIS, MANY LEAVES ARE LIKE EACH OTHER. SO, THE DIRECT ANALYSIS OF LEAF IMAGES USING THE DEEP LEARNING NETWORK CAUSES MANY ISSUES FOR MEDICINAL PLANT IDENTIFICATION. HENCE, KEEPING THE REQUIREMENT OF A METHOD AT LARGE TO HELP ALL HUMAN BEINGS, THE PROPOSED LEAF SHAPE DESCRIPTOR WITH THE DEEP LEARNING-BASED MOBILE APPLICATION IS DEVELOPED FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF IMMUNITY-BOOSTING MEDICINAL PLANTS USING A SMARTPHONE.

"PRADIPKUMAR V;ALAGU R R";AUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION OF TREE SPECIES FROM UAV IMAGES USING MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES;TODAY, THE IDENTIFICATION OF TREE SPECIES HAS BECOME ESSENTIAL IN ORDER TO PROTECT BIODIVERSITY AND ECOLOGICAL EQUILIBRIUM AND FULFIL MEDICINAL PURPOSES. IT IS BENEFICIAL FOR LARGE PARTS OF SOCIETY, FORESTERS, FARMERS, BIOLOGISTS, CONSERVATIONISTS, AND LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS. THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING TREE SPECIES BY CONVENTIONAL METHODS IS TIME-CONSUMING AND PRONE TO HUMAN ERROR. SO, A METHOD BASED ON AUTOMATIC TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION IS REQUIRED TO REDUCE HUMAN ERROR AS WELL AS TIME. THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED BY USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES. THIS PAPER DEALS WITH MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES, A SUBSET OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, WHERE DIFFERENT SUPERVISED CLASSIFIERS SUCH AS SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM), K-NEAREST NEIGHBOUR (KNN), DECISION TREE (DT), RANDOM FOREST (RF), AND EXTREME GRADIENT BOOSTING (XGBOOST) ARE USED TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENT TREE SPECIES SUCH AS BANANA, COCONUT, MANGO, OIL PALM, AND PAPAYA. TO IMPLEMENT EACH MACHINE LEARNING MODEL, FEATURES ARE EXTRACTED FROM TRAINING IMAGES USING THE HISTOGRAM OF ORIENTED GRADIENT (HOG) DESCRIPTOR. THESE FEATURE VECTORS ARE FED AS INPUTS TO THE CLASSIFIERS SO THAT THE GENERATED MODEL CAN IDENTIFY THE UNLABELLED TREE SPECIES. TO DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HOG DESCRIPTOR IN IDENTIFYING TREE SPECIES, TWO ADDITIONAL FEATURE DESCRIPTORS, GRAY-LEVEL CO-OCCURRENCE MATRIX AND LINEAR BINARY PATTERN, ARE USED. THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH MODEL IS ASSESSED USING THE CONFUSION MATRIX. THE OVERALL ACCURACY OBTAINED FOR THE CLASSIFIERS SVM, KNN, DT, RF, AND XGBOOST USING THE HOG IS 97.05%, 92.05%, 75.00%, 95.00%, AND 97.94%, RESPECTIVELY.

MORE RECENTLY, MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR PATTERN RECOGNITION HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED TO LEAF RECOGNITION IN OTHER PLANT SPECIES. THESE NEW TOOLS MAKE THE CLASSIFICATION OF CHINESE MEDICINAL PLANTS EASIER, MORE EFFICIENT AND COST EFFECTIVE. THIS STUDY SHOWED COMPARATIVE RESULTS BETWEEN MACHINE LEARNING MODELS OBTAINED FROM TWO METHODS: I) A MORPHO-COLORIMETRIC METHOD AND II) A VISIBLE (VIS)/NEAR INFRARED (NIR) SPECTRAL ANALYSIS FROM SAMPLED LEAVES OF 20 DIFFERENT CHINESE MEDICINAL PLANTS. SPECIFICALLY, THE AUTOMATED IMAGE ANALYSIS AND VIS/NIR SPECTRAL BASED PARAMETERS OBTAINED FROM LEAVES WERE USED SEPARATELY AS INPUTS TO CONSTRUCT CUSTOMIZED ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK (ANN) MODELS. RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE ANN MODEL DEVELOPED USING THE MORPHO-COLORIMETRIC PARAMETERS AS INPUTS (MODEL A) HAD AN ACCURACY OF 98.3% IN THE CLASSIFICATION OF LEAVES FOR THE 20 MEDICINAL PLANTS STUDIED. IN THE CASE OF THE MODEL BASED ON SPECTRAL DATA FROM LEAVES (MODEL B), THE ANN MODEL OBTAINED USING THE AVERAGED VIS/NIR SPECTRA PER LEAF AS INPUTS SHOWED 92.5% ACCURACY FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF ALL MEDICINAL PLANTS USED. MODEL A HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING COST EFFECTIVE, REQUIRING ONLY A NORMAL DOCUMENT SCANNER AS MEASURING INSTRUMENT. THIS METHOD CAN BE ADAPTED FOR NON-DESTRUCTIVE ASSESSMENT OF LEAVES IN-SITU BY USING PORTABLE WIRELESS SCANNERS. MODEL B COMBINES THE FAST, NON-DESTRUCTIVE ADVANTAGES OF VIS/NIR SPECTROSCOPY, WHICH CAN BE USED FOR RAPID AND NON-INVASIVE IDENTIFICATION OF CHINESE MEDICINAL PLANTS AND OTHER APPLICATIONS BY ANALYZING SPECIFIC LIGHT SPECTRA OVERTONES FROM LEAVES TO ASSESS CONCENTRATION OF PIGMENTS SUCH AS CHLOROPHYLL, ANTHOCYANINS AND OTHERS THAT ARE RELATED ACTIVE COMPOUNDS FROM THE MEDICINAL PLANTS.

DEEP LEARNING METHODS HAVE BEEN USED FOR STUDIES OF INDIVIDUAL TREE CROWN SEGMENTATION, CLASSIFICATION, AND NUMBER OF TREES IN MIXED CONIFEROUS AND BROAD-LEAVED FORESTS, BUT THE ACCURACY NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY USES BLENDMASK, A SIMPLER AND MORE EFFICIENT ALGORITHM THAT COMBINES MASK R-CNN AND YOLACT ALGORITHMS TO EFFECTIVELY COMBINE INSTANCE-LEVEL INFORMATION WITH SEMANTIC INFORMATION AT A FINER GRANULARITY LEVEL, GREATLY IMPROVING CROWN SEGMENTATION ACCURACY AND CLASSIFICATION RESULTS. THREE CONIFEROUS SPECIES AND FIVE BROAD-LEAVED SPECIES UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE IMAGES COLLECTED FROM THE JING YUE MULTISPECIES ECOLOGICAL FORESTRY SITE IN CHANGPING DISTRICT, BEIJING, WERE USED AS THE DATASET, AND THE RESULTS WERE COMPARED WITH YOLACT AND MASK R-CNN. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE METHOD DESCRIBED IN THIS WORK HAS THE HIGHEST KAPPA COEFFICIENT (0.89) AND OVERALL ACCURACY (92.14%) IN THE TEST SET. FOR SEGMENTATION ACCURACY, CONIFEROUS SPECIES' PRODUCER'S ACCURACY WAS 0.91 TO 0.95, WHEREAS THAT OF BROAD-LEAVED SPECIES WAS 0.89 TO 0.92. FOR SPECIES CLASSIFICATION, THE F1-SCORE AND MEAN AVERAGE PRECISION FOR CONIFEROUS SPECIES WERE GREATER THAN 91%, WHEREAS THOSE FOR BROAD-LEAVED SPECIES WERE 77.64% TO 85.63%. THE ACCURACY OF EXTRACTING STAND DENSITY IN LOW AND MEDIUM CANOPY DENSITY STANDS WAS 0.9909 AND 0.9422, RESPECTIVELY, WHEREAS THAT IN HIGH CANOPY DENSITY STANDS WAS 0.8913. THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT THE BLENDMASK MODEL HAS A GOOD EFFECT IN STUDYING THE CLASSIFICATION OF MULTIPLE TREE SPECIES, THE SEGMENTATION OF INDIVIDUAL TREE CROWNS, AND THE STATISTICS OF THE NUMBER OF TREES IN COMPLEX FOREST AREAS. COMPARED WITH BROAD-LEAVED FORESTS AND HIGH CANOPY DENSITY STANDS, THIS MODEL IS MORE SUITABLE FOR CONIFEROUS FOREST AND MEDIUM AND LOW CANOPY DENSITY STAND SCENARIOS.

HOWEVER, THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT OF THE KARST PLATEAU IN SOUTHWEST CHINA IS FRAGILE, THE GROUND SURFACE IS BROKEN, AND THE WEATHER IS COMPLEX AND CLOUDY, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN HIGH-QUALITY CROP SAMPLES FOR CROP INFORMATION EXTRACTION IN THIS COMPLEX ENVIRONMENT. WE OBTAINED IMAGES OF PITAYA TREES FROM PLATEAU MOUNTAIN ENVIRONMENTS USING DJI MAVIC 2 PRO UAV, CONSTRUCTED A SMALL UAV CLOSE-RANGE ACQUISITION SAMPLE DATASET, WHICH INCLUDED INITIAL, SUPPLEMENTARY, AND AUGMENTED DATASETS, COVERING SAMPLES IN COMPLEX NATURAL SCENES SUCH AS TWINING VINES, WEED AND TREE COVER, BLURRED IMAGES, AND SHADOWS. WE STUDIED THE INFLUENCE OF COMPLEX SCENES ON THE EXTRACTION ACCURACY OF PITAYA TREES USING THE U-NET MODEL TO ACCURATELY DELINEATE PITAYA TREES IN COMPLEX UAV IMAGES. THE RESULTS SHOW: (1) THE U-NET MODEL TRAINED BY THE AUGMENTED DATASET HAD THE HIGHEST RECOGNITION PRECISION OF 99.20\% FOR PITAYA TREES, F1-SCORE OF 96.66\%, AND KAPPA COEFFICIENT OF 0.91. (2) THE NUMBER OF SAMPLES AND THE COMPLEXITY OF LAND TYPES HAD STRONG IMPACT ON THE RECOGNITION ACCURACY. FROM 200 TO 21,593 SAMPLES, THE ACCURACY OF THE RECOGNITION RESULTS, F1-SCORE AND KAPPA COEFFICIENT INCREASED BY 17.47\%, 17.95\%, AND 0.26\%, RESPECTIVELY.

ONE WAY OF TRACKING SUCH ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES IS BY MEANS OF PHENOLOGY, WHICH STUDIES NATURAL PERIODIC EVENTS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO CLIMATE. PHENOLOGY IS SEEN AS THE SIMPLEST AND MOST RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON PLANTS AND ANIMALS. THE SEARCH FOR PHENOLOGICAL INFORMATION AND MONITORING SYSTEMS HAS STIMULATED MANY RESEARCH CENTERS WORLDWIDE TO PURSUE THE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE AND INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS IN THIS DIRECTION. ONE FUNDAMENTAL REQUIREMENT FOR PHENOLOGICAL SYSTEMS IS CONCERNED WITH ACHIEVING FINE-GRAINED RECOGNITION OF PLANTS. IN THIS SENSE, THE PRESENT WORK SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND SPECIFIC PROPERTIES OF EACH TARGET PLANT SPECIES AND TO PROVIDE THE SOLUTIONS FOR GATHERING SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH PLANTS FOR FURTHER LEVELS OF RECOGNITION AND EXPLORATION IN RELATED TASKS. IN THIS WORK, WE ADDRESS SOME IMPORTANT QUESTIONS SUCH AS: (I) HOW SPECIES FROM THE SAME LEAF FUNCTIONAL GROUP DIFFER FROM EACH OTHER; (II) HOW DIFFERENT PATTERN CLASSIFIERS MIGHT BE COMBINED TO IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS RESULTS IN TARGET SPECIES IDENTIFICATION; AND (III) WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE GOOD CLASSIFICATION RESULTS WITH FEWER CLASSIFIERS FOR FINE-GRAINED PLANT SPECIES IDENTIFICATION. IN THIS SENSE, WE PERFORM DIFFERENT ANALYSIS CONSIDERING RGB COLOR INFORMATION CHANNELS FROM A DIGITAL HEMISPHERICAL LENS CAMERA IN DIFFERENT HOURS OF DAY AND PLANT SPECIES. A STUDY ABOUT THE CORRELATION OF CLASSIFIERS ASSOCIATED WITH TIME SERIES EXTRACTED FROM DIGITAL IMAGES IS ALSO PERFORMED. WE ADOPT A SUCCESSFUL SELECTION AND FUSION FRAMEWORK TO COMBINE THE MOST SUITABLE CLASSIFIERS AND FEATURES IMPROVING THE PLANT IDENTIFICATION DECISION-MAKING TASK AS IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DEVELOP JUST A SINGLE â€œSILVER BULLETâ€ IMAGE DESCRIPTOR THAT WOULD CAPTURE ALL SUBTLE DISCRIMINATORY FEATURES OF PLANTS WITHIN THE SAME FUNCTIONAL GROUP.

IN RECENT YEARS, TRANSFORMERS HAVE ACHIEVED EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE IN A VARIETY OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND IMAGE RECOGNITION TASKS THROUGH THE SELF-ATTENTION MECHANISM. THEREFORE, THIS PAPER PROPOSES A GRAPE LEAF DISEASE RECOGNITION MODEL NAMED DENSE CONVOLUTIONAL TRANSFORMER (DENSCT). THE COMPACT CONVOLUTIONAL TRANSFORMER (CCT) IS USED AS THE BACKBONE IN THIS MODEL, WHICH IMPROVES THE CONVOLUTIONAL MODULE OF THE ORIGINAL MODEL BY INTRODUCING DENSELY CONNECTED MODULES, ENHANCING THE TRANSFER AND REUSE OF FEATURES BETWEEN NETWORKS. THIS ALSO MODIFIES THE SINGLE-SCALE FEATURE EXTRACTION METHOD OF THE ORIGINAL MODEL TO MULTI-SCALE, WHICH IMPROVES THE FEATURE EXTRACTION PERFORMANCE. FINALLY, THE MODEL WAS TRAINED ON TWO SMALL-SCALE DATASETS FROM SCRATCH, AND THE RECOGNITION ACCURACY OF THE FINAL MODEL ON THE TEST SETS REACHED 89.19% AND 93.92%. COMPARED WITH CCT, DENSENET121, RESNET50, MOBILENETV3 AND VIT, THE RECOGNITION ACCURACY IMPROVED BY 4.73%, 3.38%, 10.81%, 0.68% AND 18.24% ON THE FIRST DATASET AND 6.08%, 5.41%, 1.35%, 3.38% AND 12.84% ON THE SECOND DATASET.

HOWEVER, THE EXISTING PLANT SPECIES RECOGNITION METHODS HAVE LOW RECOGNITION ACCURACY AND DO NOT MEET PROFESSIONAL REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS OF RECOGNITION ACCURACY. THEREFORE, SHUFFLENETV2 WAS IMPROVED BY COMBINING THE CURRENT HOT CONCERN MECHANISM, CONVOLUTION KERNEL SIZE ADJUSTMENT, CONVOLUTION TAILORING, AND CSP TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY AND REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF COMPUTATION IN THIS STUDY. SIX CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK MODELS WITH SUFFICIENT TRAINABLE PARAMETERS WERE DESIGNED FOR DIFFERENTIATION LEARNING. THE SGD ALGORITHM IS USED TO OPTIMIZE THE TRAIN-ING PROCESS TO AVOID OVERFITTING OR FALLING INTO THE LOCAL OPTIMUM. IN THIS PAPER, A CONVENTIONAL PLANT IMAGE DATASET TJAU10 COLLECTED BY CELL PHONES IN A NATURAL CONTEXT WAS CONSTRUCTED, CONTAINING 3000 IMAGES OF 10 PLANT SPECIES ON THE CAMPUS OF TIANJIN AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY. FINALLY, THE IMPROVED MODEL IS COMPARED WITH THE BASELINE VER-SION OF THE MODEL, WHICH ACHIEVES BETTER RESULTS IN TERMS OF IMPROVING ACCURACY AND REDUCING THE COMPUTATIONAL EFFORT. THE RECOGNITION ACCURACY TESTED ON THE TJAU10 DATASET REACHES UP TO 98.3%, AND THE RECOGNITION PRECISION REACHES UP TO 93.6%, WHICH IS 5.1% BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL MODEL AND REDUCES THE COMPUTATIONAL EFFORT BY ABOUT 31% COMPARED WITH THE ORIGINAL MODEL.

BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION IS CRITICAL FOR THE SURVIVAL AND SUSTAINABILITY OF EACH ECOSYSTEM AND SINCE PLANT SPECIES RECOGNITION IN THEIR NATURAL HABITATS IS THE FIRST PROCESS IN PLANT DIVERSITY PROTECTION, AN AUTOMATIC SPECIES CLASSIFICATION IN THE WILD WOULD GREATLY HELP THE SPECIES ANALYSIS AND CONSEQUENTLY BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION ON EARTH. COMPUTER VISION APPROACHES CAN BE USED FOR AUTOMATIC SPECIES ANALYSIS. MODERN COMPUTER VISION APPROACHES ARE BASED ON DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES. A STANDARD DATASET IS ESSENTIAL IN ORDER TO PERFORM A DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHM. HENCE, THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO PROVIDE A STANDARD DATASET OF CHENOPODIACEAE IMAGES. THIS DATASET IS CALLED ACHENY AND CONTAINS 27030 IMAGES OF 30 CHENOPODIACEAE SPECIES IN THEIR NATURAL HABITATS. THE OTHER GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE APPLICABILITY OF ACHENY DATASET BY USING DEEP LEARNING MODELS. THEREFORE, TWO NOVEL DEEP LEARNING MODELS BASED ON ACHENY DATASET ARE INTRODUCED: FIRST, A LIGHTWEIGHT DEEP MODEL WHICH IS TRAINED FROM SCRATCH AND IS DESIGNED INNOVATIVELY TO BE AGILE AND FAST. SECOND, A MODEL BASED ON THE EFFICIENTNET-B1 ARCHITECTURE, WHICH IS PRE-TRAINED ON IMAGENET AND IS FINE-TUNED ON ACHENY. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE TWO PROPOSED MODELS CAN DO CHENOPODIACEAE FINE-GRAINED SPECIES RECOGNITION WITH PROMISING ACCURACY.

A POTENTIAL WAY TO ADDRESS SUCH DOMAIN ADAPTATION PROBLEM IS GENERATIVE: HALLUCINATE HOW A HERBARIUM IMAGE WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE WHEN IT WAS IN THE FIELD, AND USE SUCH SYNTHETIC, FRESH AND GREEN IMAGE FOR PLANT IDENTIFICATION PURPOSES.

IN THIS WORK WE EXPLORE HERBARIUM SENESCENCE REVERSION VIA UNPAIRED DATA. THE LACK OF PAIRS AT SPECIMEN LEVEL PRESENTS ITS OWN CHALLENGES, AS CAPTURING THE INTRICACIES OF EACH SPECIES DEPENDS ON IMAGES OF DIFFERENT SPECIMENS FROM DIFFERENT DOMAINS.

THE EXCITING POSSIBILITY OF USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS AND ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE TOOLS SUCH AS DEEP LEARNING AND NEURAL NETWORKS FOR MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF NMR DATA HAS OPENED UP NEW AVENUES OF RESEARCH IN INTEGRATING â€˜BIG DATAâ€™ METHODS WITH PLANT METABOLOMICS. QUANTITATIVE METABOLITE FINGERPRINTING USING TWO-DIMENSIONAL (2D) ULTRAFAST AND HIGH-RESOLUTION MAGIC ANGLE SPINNING (HR-MAS) NMR EXPERIMENTS HAS PROVIDED UNIQUE PERSPECTIVES ON THE INTERACTIONS OF PLANT METABOLIC NETWORKS AND THEIR RESPONSES TO EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT STRESSES. PLANT NMR METABOLOMIC STUDIES HAVE CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF PLANT CLASSIFICATION AND TAXONOMY, THE INTERACTION OF PLANT METABOLIC NETWORKS, BIOACTIVITY AND MECHANISM OF ACTION OF SIGNIFICANT METABOLITES IN MEDICINALLY IMPORTANT PLANTS, GENETICALLY MODIFIED PLANTS AND THEIR ECOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS, PLANTâ€“ORGANISM INTERACTIONS, PLANT DEFENSE AGAINST HERBIVORE AND PATHOGEN ATTACKS, AND PLANT METABOLOME RESPONSE TO ABIOTIC STRESS.

HOLMES M;CHANGING TECHNIQUES IN CROP PLANT CLASSIFICATION MOLECULARIZATION AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF AGRICULTURAL BOTANY DURING THE 1980S;MODERN METHODS OF ANALYSING BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS, INCLUDING PROTEIN AND DNA SEQUENCING, ARE INCREASINGLY THE OBJECTS OF HISTORICAL STUDY. YET TWENTIETH-CENTURY TAXONOMIC TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKED IN ONE OF THEIR MOST IMPORTANT CONTEXTS: AGRICULTURAL BOTANY. THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THIS OMISSION BY HARNESSING UNEXAMINED ARCHIVAL MATERIAL FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF AGRICULTURAL BOTANY (NIAB), A BRITISH PLANT SCIENCE ORGANIZATION. DURING THE 1980S THE NIAB CARRIED OUT THREE OVERLAPPING RESEARCH PROGRAMMES IN CROP IDENTIFICATION AND ANALYSIS: ELECTROPHORESIS, NEAR INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY (NIRS) AND MACHINE VISION SYSTEMS. FOR EACH OF THESE THREE PROGRAMMES, CONTEMPORARY ECONOMIC, STATUTORY AND SCIENTIFIC FACTORS BEHIND THEIR UPTAKE BY THE NIAB ARE DISCUSSED. THIS APPROACH REVEALS SIGNIFICANT LINKS BETWEEN TAXONOMIC PRACTICE AT THE NIAB AND HISTORICAL QUESTIONS AROUND AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND SCIENTIFIC VALUES. SUCH LINKS ARE OF FURTHER IMPORTANCE GIVEN THAT THE TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED BY RESEARCHERS AT THE NIAB DURING THE 1980S REMAIN PART OF CROP CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES ISSUED BY INTERNATIONAL BODIES TODAY.

RECENTLY, DEEP LEARNING-BASED PLANT IDENTIFICATION METHODS HAVE DRAWN INCREASING INTEREST AND SHOWN FAVORABLE PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER, EXISTING METHODS DO NOT CONSIDER PLANT SPATIAL STRUCTURE AND THEIR SIMILARITIES EXPLICITLY. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A ROBUST SPATIAL-STRUCTURE SIAMESE NETWORK (3SN) FOR PLANT IDENTIFICATION, WHICH HAS THE FOLLOWING ADVANTAGES: (1) IT MODELS THE SPATIAL STRUCTURE OF A PLANT BY RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS EXPLOITING THEIR CAPABILITY TO CAPTURE LONG-RANGE DEPENDENCIES AMONG SEQUENTIAL DATA, WHICH ENABLES IT TO CAPTURE EVEN A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SPECIFIC PLANT AND DISTRACTORS. (2) THE PLANT SIMILARITY MODELING IS ACHIEVED EFFECTIVELY BY A SIAMESE NETWORK WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF IMAGE PAIRS. IN THIS WAY, THE PLANT CLASSIFICATION TASK AND SIAMESE LEARNING TASK ARE LEARNED JOINTLY IN A UNIFIED FRAMEWORK, WHERE BOTH CAN ENHANCE AND COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER.

"CAMPOS-LEAL J;YEE-RENDON A;VEGA-LOPEZ I";SIMPLIFYING VGG16 FOR PLANT SPECIES IDENTIFICATION;PLANT SPECIES IDENTIFICATION REPRESENTS AN EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGE FOR MACHINE LEARNING DUE TO VISUAL INTERSPECIES SIMILARITIES AND LARGE INTRASPECIES VARIATIONS. FURTHERMORE, RESEARCH LITERATURE REPORTS THAT PLANT SPECIES IDENTIFICATION USUALLY LACKS SUFFICIENTLY LARGE DATASETS FOR TRAINING CLASSIFICATION MODELS. IN THIS PAPER, WE ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM WITH A MODEL THAT SIMPLIFIES THE VGG-16 ARCHITECTURE, THE N-VGG MODEL. THE IDEA BEHIND N-VGG IS TO REDUCE EXPERIMENTALLY OBSERVED OVERFITTING ON VGG-16 BY USING AS FEW TRAINABLE PARAMETERS AS POSSIBLE. TO DO THIS, WE SUBSTITUTE THE FLATTENING LAYER ON THE VGG ARCHITECTURE WITH A GLOBAL AVERAGE POOLING LAYER. THIS REDUCES THE SIZE OF THE FEATURE VECTOR. IN ADDITION, WE ELIMINATE ONE OF THE TWO FULLY-CONNECTED LAYERS AND USE A NEW HYPER-PARAMETER, N, TO INDICATE THE NUMBER OF NODES ON THE REMAINING LAYER. TO SHOW THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE N-VGG MODEL, WE CONDUCTED EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTATION. WE TRAINED N-VGG ON FIVE DATASETS FOR PLANT SPECIES IDENTIFICATION. FOUR OF THESE DATASETS ARE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AND HAVE BEEN WIDELY USED AS BENCHMARKS FOR PLANT IDENTIFICATION MODELS. FOR ALL DATASETS, WE COMPARE THE ACCURACY OF N-VGG TO THAT OF THE VGG-16, INCEPTION-V4, AND EFFICIENNET-B3 MODELS. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE N-VGG MODEL ACHIEVED THE BEST CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE FOR ALL BUT ONE DATASETS, WHEREAS ALL THE MODELS SHOWED A REMARKABLE PERFORMANCE FOR THE REMAINING DATASET. THIS EVIDENCE SUPPORTS OUR INITIAL IDEA THAT, FOR PLANT SPECIES CLASSIFICATION, SOME ACCURACY MIGHT BE LOST DUE TO OVERFITTING AND THAT HAVING FEWER TRAINABLE PARAMETERS HELPS IN PRODUCING A MORE ROBUST MODEL.

IDENTIFYING THEIR LOCATIONS ARE MANDATORY PARTS OF THE STRATEGIES BEING DEVELOPED TO CONTROL THEM. REMOTE SENSING ALONG WITH MACHINE LEARNING ARE ALREADY PROVEN AND EFFECTIVE TOOLS FOR MONITORING INVASIVE SPECIES, ESPECIALLY TREES, SHRUBS, AND TALL PERENNIALS. HOWEVER, ANNUAL VINE SPECIES ARE PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TO MAP USING REMOTE SENSING BECAUSE OF THEIR DYNAMIC PLANT GROWTH AND THE MOVEMENT OF SHOOTS DURING THE GROWING SEASON. THEREFORE, THE PHENOLOGICAL PHASE IN WHICH THE DATA IS ACQUIRED, AND THE SYNCHRONIZATION OF AIRBORNE DATA ACQUISITION WITH ON-GROUND REFERENCE DATA, MAY BE KEY FACTORS FOR CORRECT PLANT CLASSIFICATION. THIS RESEARCH AIMED TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: (I) WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF ACQUIRING SYNCHRONIZED ON-GROUND DATA AND HYPERSPECTRAL DATA IN DIFFERENT PHASES OF PLANTSâ€™ PHENOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ON THE ANNUAL VINE IAPS (INVASIVE ALIEN PLANT SPECIES) CLASSIFICATION RESULTS? (II) HOW DOES THE LACK OF SYNCHRONIZATION WHILE OBTAINING HYPERSPECTRAL AND ON-GROUND DATA COLLECTION IMPACT ANNUAL VINE IAPS MAPPING RESULTS? (III) DOES MULTITEMPORAL IMAGE FUSION IMPROVE THE RESULTS OF ANNUAL VINE IAPS CLASSIFICATION? FOR THIS PURPOSE, RESEARCH WAS CARRIED OUT ON ECHINOCYSTIS LOBATA, AN ANNUAL VINE SPECIES CONSIDERED HIGHLY INVASIVE IN EUROPE. THE OBTAINED RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE PHENOLOGICAL PHASE IN WHICH THE DATA IS ACQUIRED HAS A VERY STRONG INFLUENCE ON THE QUALITY OF THE CLASSIFICATION RESULT. THE PERIOD OF FLOWERING (SUMMER) WITH THE GREATEST COVERAGE OF THE AREA WITH SHOOTS WAS OPTIMAL FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF ECHINOCYSTIS LOBATA WITH F1 CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY OF 0.87 Â± 0.04. THE ACCURACY OF CLASSIFICATIONS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FOR SPRING (F1 = 0.64 Â± 0.04) AND AUTUMN (F1 = 0.75 Â± 0.05). OBTAINING ON-GROUND REFERENCE DATA THAT IS MISMATCHED TEMPORALLY WITH HYPERSPECTRAL DATA CAUSES A DECREASE IN THE ACCURACY OF THE RESULT UP TO 0.08 (FROM F1 = 0.64 TO 0.56) IN RELATION TO DATA OBTAINED SYNCHRONOUSLY. IN THE MULTITEMPORAL IMAGE FUSION METHOD, USING HYPERSPECTRAL DATA LINKED FROM DIFFERENT PHASES OF PLANTSâ€™ DEVELOPMENT TO CLASSIFY AN IMAGE HAD A MINIMAL IMPROVEMENT IN CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY COMPARED TO CLASSIFICATIONS TRAINED ON IMAGES FROM ONE PHENOLOGICAL STAGE. THE MAIN CONCLUSION IS THAT MAPPING AN ANNUAL VINE USING REMOTE SENSING AND MACHINE LEARNING IS POSSIBLE AND HIGHLY EFFECTIVE, PROVIDED THE REMOTE SENSING AND ON-GROUND DATA ARE OBTAINED IN STRICT SYNCHRONIZATION AND THE APPROPRIATE PHENOLOGICAL PHASE. FOR THE MOST EFFICIENT CLASSIFICATION RESULTS, A SINGLE DATA ACQUISITION PER YEAR IS ENOUGH, EVEN IN THE CASE OF ANNUAL VINE IAPS.

"AKTER R;HOSEN M";CNNBASED LEAF IMAGE CLASSIFICATION FOR BANGLADESHI MEDICINAL PLANT RECOGNITION;CLASSIFYING PLANT SPECIES HAS TAKEN MUCH ATTENTION IN THE RESEARCH AREA TO HELP PEOPLE RECOGNIZING PLANTS EASILY. IN RECENT YEARS, THE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNN) HAVE ACHIEVED TREMENDOUS COMPUTER VISION RESULTS, ESPECIALLY IN IMAGE CLASSIFICATION. USUALLY, HUMANS FIND IT DIFFICULT TO RECOGNIZE PROPER MEDICINAL PLANTS. IT REQUIRES THE INTUITION OF AN EXPERT BOTANIST, WHICH IS A TIME CONSUMING MANUAL TASK. IN THIS RESEARCH, WE PROPOSED AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM FOR THE MEDICINAL PLANT CLASSIFICATION, WHICH WILL HELP PEOPLE IDENTIFY USEFUL PLANT SPECIES QUICKLY. A NEW DATASET OF 10 MEDICINAL PLANTS OF BANGLADESH IS INTRODUCED, COLLECTED FROM DIFFERENT REGIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AND SOME STATE-OF-THE IMAGES COLLECTED FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES. AFTER THAT, A THREE-LAYER CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK IS EMPLOYED TO EXTRACT THE HIGH-LEVEL FEATURES FOR THE CLASSIFICATION TRAINED WITH THE DATA AUGMENTATION TECHNIQUE.

THE DISADVANTAGE OF SUPERVISED LEARNING TECHNIQUES IS THAT THEY ARE LIMITED TO LEARN FROM LABELLED DATASETS WHICH ARE OFTEN EXPENSIVE TO OBTAIN. IN THIS PAPER, A NOVEL DECISION FUSION FRAMEWORK IS PROPOSED BY COMBINING SEMI-SUPERVISED CLUSTERING WITH THE WELL KNOWN IMAGE FEATURES ANALYSIS METHODS IN COMPUTER VISION. INITIALLY THE LEAVE IMAGE FEATURES ARE GENERATED BY APPLYING THE GREY LEVEL CO-OCCURRENCE MATRIX ANALYSIS TO THE PROCESSED LEAVE IMAGES TRANSFORMED BY GABOR OR LAPLACIAN OF GAUSSIAN FILTERS. THEN AN ON-LINE SPHERICAL K-MEANS CLUSTERING TECHNIQUE, GUIDED BY A MINIMUM NUMBER OF LABELLED LEAVES, IS USED TO TRAIN THE BASE CLASSIFIERS.

"GOÃ‹AU H;BONNET P;JOLY A";OVERVIEW OF PLANTCLEF 2022 IMAGEBASED PLANT IDENTIFICATION AT GLOBAL SCALE;IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN 300,000 SPECIES OF VASCULAR PLANTS IN THE WORLD. INCREASING OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THESE SPECIES IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION (AGRICULTURE, CONSTRUCTION, PHARMACOPOEIA, ETC.), ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE BIODIVERSITY CRISIS. HOWEVER, THE BURDEN OF SYSTEMATIC PLANT IDENTIFICATION BY HUMAN EXPERTS STRONGLY PENALIZES THE AGGREGATION OF NEW DATA AND KNOWLEDGE. SINCE THEN, AUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION HAS MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN RECENT YEARS AS HIGHLIGHTED DURING ALL PREVIOUS EDITIONS OF PLANTCLEF. DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES NOW SEEM MATURE ENOUGH TO ADDRESS THE ULTIMATE BUT REALISTIC PROBLEM OF GLOBAL IDENTIFICATION OF PLANT BIODIVERSITY IN SPITE OF MANY PROBLEMS THAT THE DATA MAY PRESENT (A HUGE NUMBER OF CLASSES, VERY STRONGLY UNBALANCED CLASSES, PARTIALLY ERRONEOUS IDENTIFICATIONS, DUPLICATIONS, VARIABLE VISUAL QUALITY, DIVERSITY OF VISUAL CONTENTS SUCH AS PHOTOS OR HERBARIUM SHEETS, ETC). THE PLANTCLEF2022 CHALLENGE EDITION PROPOSES TO TAKE A STEP IN THIS DIRECTION BY TACKLING A MULTI-IMAGE (AND METADATA) CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM WITH A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF CLASSES (80K PLANT SPECIES). THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE RESOURCES AND EVALUATIONS OF THE CHALLENGE, SUMMARIZES THE APPROACHES AND SYSTEMS EMPLOYED BY THE PARTICIPATING RESEARCH GROUPS, AND PROVIDES AN ANALYSIS OF KEY FINDINGS.

AS A RESULT, A LOT OF ACADEMICS ARE VERY INTERESTED IN STUDYING AUTOMATIC MEDICINAL PLANT CLASSIFICATION. A POWERFUL CLASSIFIER THAT CAN ACCURATELY CATEGORIZE THERAPEUTIC PLANTS IN REAL TIME MUST BE CREATED. THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS THE EFFECTIVENESS AND PREDICTABILITY OF MANY MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS DEPLOYED IN RECENT YEARS TO CATEGORIZE PLANTS USING PICTURES OF THEIR LEAVES. THIS STUDY CONTAINS IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES FOR SOME CLASSIFIERS THAT ARE USED TO RECOGNIZE LEAVES AND EXTRACT IMPORTANT LEAF CHARACTERISTICS. EARLY PLANT DISEASE IDENTIFICATION IS ESSENTIAL BECAUSE PLANT DISEASES HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE GROWTH OF THEIR SPECIFIC SPECIES. THERE ARE SEVERAL MACHINE LEARNING MODELS THAT ARE USED TO IDENTIFY AND CLASSIFY THE SIGNS OF PLANT DISEASES, BUT RECENT ADVANCEMENTS IN DEEP LEARNING, A SUBSET OF ML, SEEM TO OFFER TREMENDOUS PROMISE FOR IMPROVED ACCURACY.

THERE ARE SEVERAL APPROACHES TO PLANT STRESS IDENTIFICATION. HOWEVER, MOST OF THESE APPROACHES ARE BASED ON THE USE OF EXPERT EMPLOYEES OR INVASIVE TECHNIQUES. IN GENERAL, EXPERT EMPLOYEES HAVE A GOOD PERFORMANCE ON DIFFERENT PLANTS, BUT THIS ALTERNATIVE REQUIRES SUFFICIENT STAFF IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE QUALITY CROPS. ON THE OTHER HAND, INVASIVE TECHNIQUES NEED THE DISMEMBERMENT OF THE LEAVES. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, AN ALTERNATIVE IS TO PROCESS AN IMAGE SEEKING TO INTERPRET PATTERNS OF THE IMAGES WHERE THE PLANT GEOMETRY MAY BE OBSERVED, THUS REMOVING THE QUALIFIED LABOR DEPENDENCY OR THE CROP DISMEMBERMENT, BUT ADDING THE CHALLENGE OF HAVING TO INTERPRET IMAGES AMBIGUITIES CORRECTLY. MOTIVATED BY THE LATTER, WE PROPOSE A NEW APPROACH FOR PLANT STRESS RECOGNITION USING DEEP LEARNING AND 3D RECONSTRUCTION. THIS STRATEGY COMBINES THE ABSTRACTION POWER OF DEEP LEARNING AND THE VISUAL PATTERNS OF PLANT GEOMETRY. FOR THAT, OUR METHODOLOGY HAS THREE STEPS. FIRST, THE PLANT RECOGNITION STEP PROVIDES THE SEGMENTATION, LOCATION, AND DELIMITATION OF THE CROP. SECOND, WE PROPOSE A LEAF DETECTION ANALYSIS TO CLASSIFY AND LOCATE THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT LEAVES.

"GOYAL N;GUPTA K;KUMAR N";CLUSTERINGBASED HIERARCHICAL FRAMEWORK FOR MULTICLASS CLASSIFICATION OF LEAF IMAGES;THIS ARTICLE INTRODUCES A MULTICLASS CLASSIFICATION APPROACH ACCUSTOMING THE BENEFITS OF PARTITIONING-BASED STRATEGIES AND HIERARCHICAL TECHNIQUES. THE PROPOSED HIERARCHICAL FRAMEWORK CREATES A HIERARCHY WITH THE NOTION OF GROUPING CLASSES WITH SIMILAR TRAITS AS ONE GROUP. IT OVERCOMES THE DEFICIENCY OF THE EXISTING MULTICLASS EXTENSION APPROACHES, VIZ., NONLINEARITY, IMBALANCED CLASS CLASSIFICATION, AND INCREASING CLASSIFICATION COST WITH INCREASING NUMBER OF CLASSES. THE HIERARCHICAL FRAMEWORK PRESENTS THE IDEA OF DECOMPOSING SEVERAL CLASSES HIERARCHICALLY, WHERE EVERY CLUSTER CONTAINS A SET OF CLASSES HAVING SIMILAR TRAITS. THE APPROACH AIMS TO MAXIMIZE THE INTERCLUSTER DISTANCE AND MINIMIZE THE INTRACLUSTER DISTRIBUTION. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROPOSED METHOD IS EVALUATED ON REAL-WORLD AND COMPLEX PROBLEMS OF PLANT RECOGNITION. THREE LEAF IMAGE DATASETS ARE CONSIDERED FOR PERFORMANCE EVALUATION USING A SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE. THE RESULTS SIGNIFY THAT THE PROPOSED APPROACH FOR MULTICLASS CLASSIFICATION IS AN EFFICIENT APPROACH WITH SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED RECOGNITION ACCURACY. IT IS A ROBUST AND EFFECTIVE APPROACH WITH THE LEAST COMPUTATIONAL COST. THE SPEEDUP FACTOR OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH IN THE BINARY STRUCTURE IS 16, 6.5, AND 5.5 AS COMPARED TO A ONE-VERSUS-ONE TRADITIONAL SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE FOR FLAVIA, SWEDISH, AND SELF-COLLECTED LEAF DATASETS, RESPECTIVELY.

"ARAFAT S;ARSHAD N;KHAN R";HOLISTIC BASED PLANT IDENTIFICATION USING DEEP LEARNING;"PLANTS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT FORMS OF LIFE ON EARTH. THEY ARE THE FUNDAMENTAL ASSET FOR HUMAN PROSPERITY, FURNISHING US WITH OXYGEN AND FOOD. HUMANS HAVE WIDELY UTILIZED PLANTS IN MEDICATION, FOOD FORMATION, AND THE COSMETIC BUSINESS WORLDWIDE IN THEIR DAILY LIFE ACTIVITIES. IDENTIFICATION OF PLANTS IS EXTREMELY A CHALLENGING TASK DUE TO THE RECURSIVE NATURE OF THE SHAPES OF PLANTS. MOREOVER, IDENTIFICATION HAS BEEN DONE ON A FEW CATEGORIES AND IS LIMITED TO VEINS OR LEAF PATTERNS. THIS PAPER INTRODUCED AN AUTOMATED PLANT CLASSIFICATION FRAMEWORK FOR RECOGNIZING PLANTS DEPENDENT ON THEIR HOLISTIC SHAPE. THE SYSTEM USES IMAGE PREPROCESSING, DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES, AND RESNET18 TO IDENTIFY PLANTS THROUGH THE CAMERA; IT WILL GIVE THEIR NAMES IN URDU, ENGLISH, AND THE PLANT'S SCIENTIFIC NAME AS AN OUTPUT. MOREOVER, THE SYSTEM CAN DESCRIBE THE PLANT ALONG WITH ITS AUDIO. THE METHODOLOGY WAS EVALUATED USING TWO DATASETS. THE FIRST DATASET, GRANDYMU, CONSISTS OF 70 DIFFERENT PLANT SPECIES CONTAINING 3500 IMAGES, AND THE SECOND IS THE FAMOUS SWEDISH LEAF DATASET.

"LU R;MO Y;YAO W;LI Y";A LEAF RECOGNITION ALGORITHM BASED ON KNN CLASSIFIER;IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE DIFFICULTY OF IDENTIFYING PLANTS AND STIMULATE PEOPLEâ€™S INTEREST IN PLANT CULTIVATION, A LEAF RECOGNITION MODEL USING KNN CLASSIFIER IS PROPOSED ACCORDING TO THE TEXTURE, COLOR AND MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES OF LEAF IMAGES. THE GENERAL FRAMEWORK OF LEAF RECOGNITION IS DIVIDED INTO TWO STEPS: TRAINING AND CLASSIFICATION. AT THE TRAINING STEP, THE TRAINING LEAF SAMPLE WITH KNOWN CLASSIFICATION RESULTS IS PROCESSED THROUGH MULTIPLE STEPS SUCH AS IMAGE PREPROCESSING, FEATURES EXTRACTION INCLUDING SHAPE, TEXTURE AND COLOR FEATURES TO OBTAIN THE LEAF FEATURE MODEL DATABASE. AFTER COMPLETING THE LEAF MODEL TRAINING, IT ENTERS THE CLASSIFICATION STAGE. AT THIS STAGE, LEAVES WITH UNKNOWN CLASSIFICATION CAN BE RECOGNIZED. FIRST, THE TEST LEAF IMAGE DATA IS PROCESSED WITH THE SAME IMAGE PREPROCESSING, FEATURES EXTRACTION AS IN THE ABOVE TRAINING STAGE. THEN, IT IS INPUT TO KNN CLASSIFIER TO COMPLETE LEAF CLASSIFICATION, AND THE FUNCTION OF PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION IS REALIZED.

"ABISHA A;BHARATHI N";FEATURE EXTRACTION FROM PLANT LEAVES AND CLASSIFICATION OF PLANT HEALTH USING MACHINE LEARNING;FEATURE EXTRACTION (FE) IS AN IMPORTANT METHOD THAT CONTRIBUTES DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION ESPECIALLY WHEN EXTRACTING THE FEATURES FROM IMAGES. IT IS THE METHOD OF CONVERTING THE INPUT IMAGES INTO A SET OF FEATURES UNDERSTANDABLE BY THE SYSTEM OR SOFTWARE. WHILE PROCESSING IMAGES, IT IS DESIRABLE TO EXTRACT FEATURES THAT ARE ORIENTED TOWARD DISCERNMENT BETWEEN TWO OR MORE CLASSES. IN THIS PROPOSED METHOD, TWO CLASSES ARE CONSIDERED AS INFECTED AND HEALTHY, AND DATA IS DISTRIBUTED INTO SIX CASES. FEATURES ARE EXTRACTED FROM THE PLANT IMAGES USING FEATURE DESCRIPTORS HU MOMENTS, HARALICK TEXTURE AND COLOR HISTOGRAM. AFTER FEATURE EXTRACTION, THE IMAGES ARE CLASSIFIED AS INFECTED OR HEALTHY BASED ON THE FEATURE DESCRIPTORS. THE EXTRACTED DATA ARE TRAINED WITH THE VARIOUS CLASSIFIER MODELS SUCH AS LR, LDA, KNN, CART AND RF, AND VALIDATION IS PERFORMED. 10Â K CROSS-VALIDATION IS USED, AND THE THREE BEST ALGORITHMS ARE CHOSEN TO CLASSIFY AND PREDICT THE MODEL. AMONG THESE MODELS, RF, CART AND KNN HAVE GIVEN BETTER PERFORMANCE, RESPECTIVELY.

IT NEEDS DIFFERENT ACCLIMATIZATION CONDITIONS IN THESE LIFE STAGES. A DATASET CONSISTING OF 10,000 PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE STRAWBERRY PLANT WAS PREPARED. USING THIS DATASET, CLASSIFICATION IN CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS WAS PERFORMED IN MATRIX LABORATORY (MATLAB). NINE DIFFERENT ALGORITHMS WERE USED IN THIS PROCESS. THEY WERE REALIZED IN RESNET101 ARCHITECTURE, AND THE HIGHEST ACCURACY RATE WAS 99.8%. A LOW-RESOLUTION CAMERA WAS USED WHILE GROWING STRAWBERRY PLANTS IN THE APPLICATION GREENHOUSE. EVERY DAY AT 10:00, A PICTURE OF THE STRAWBERRY PLANT WAS TAKEN. THE CAPTURED IMAGE WAS PROCESSED IN RESNET101 ARCHITECTURE. THE RESULT OF THE DETECTION PROCESS APPEARED ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN AND WAS SENT TO THE MICROCONTROLLER VIA A USB CONNECTION. THE MICROCONTROLLER ADJUSTED AIR-CONDITIONING IN THE GREENHOUSE ACCORDING TO THE STATE OF THE STRAWBERRY PLANT. FOR THIS, IT DECIDED BASED ON THE DATA RECEIVED FROM THE TEMPERATURE, HUMIDITY, WIND DIRECTION, AND WIND SPEED SENSORS OUTSIDE THE GREENHOUSE AND THE TEMPERATURE, HUMIDITY, AND SOIL MOISTURE SENSORS INSIDE THE GREENHOUSE. IN ADDITION, ALL DATA FROM THE SENSORS AND THE LIFE STAGE OF THE PLANT WERE DISPLAYED WITH A MOBILE APPLICATION. THE MOBILE APPLICATION ALSO PROVIDED THE POSSIBILITY FOR MANUAL CONTROL. IN THE STUDY, THE GREENHOUSE WAS DIVIDED INTO TWO. STRAWBERRIES WERE GROWN WITH THE HYBRID SYSTEM ON ONE SIDE OF THE GREENHOUSE AND A NORMAL SYSTEM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GREENHOUSE.

"BOSTON T;VAN D A";SOME EXPERIMENTS IN AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION OF AUSTRALIAN PLANTS USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS;ACCURATE PLANT IDENTIFICATION IS A SKILL THAT GENERALLY REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE AND ADVANCED TRAINING. HOWEVER, PLANT IDENTIFICATION IS USEFUL TO A BROAD RANGE OF PEOPLE WITHIN SOCIETY, FROM CONSERVATIONISTS AND FARMERS TO CITIZEN SCIENTISTS. ACCESS TO ACCURATE, WIDELY AVAILABLE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE IDENTITY AND DISTRIBUTION OF LIVING SPECIES IS CRITICAL FOR BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. AUTOMATED PLANT IDENTIFICATION HAS UNDERGONE MAJOR ADVANCES SINCE 2012 WITH THE APPLICATION OF CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS) FROM THE EMERGING FIELD OF DEEP LEARNING. THIS BRANCH OF MACHINE LEARNING HAS SHOWN REMARKABLE ACCURACY IN IMAGE CLASSIFICATION AND VISUAL OBJECT RECOGNITION WHEN APPLIED TO STILL IMAGES THROUGH COMPETITIONS SUCH AS THE IMAGENET LARGE SCALE VISUAL RECOGNITION CHALLENGE. THIS RESEARCH PROJECT USED TRANSFER LEARNING TO FINE-TUNE PRE-TRAINED DEEP LEARNING CNNS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED FOR THE IMAGENET CHALLENGE, SUCH AS INCEPTION AND RESNET, WHICH ARE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE THROUGH TENSORFLOW HUB. THE MODELS WERE APPLIED TO THE AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION OF IMAGES OF PLANTS EXTRACTED FROM THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL BOTANIC GARDENS AUSTRALIAN PLANT IMAGE INDEX AND VALIDATED USING ADDITIONAL IMAGES FROM THE ATLAS OF LIVING AUSTRALIA (ALA) AND OTHER INTERNET SOURCES. A COMPARISON OF MODEL PERFORMANCE WAS UNDERTAKEN USING THREE DIFFERENT DATASETS: WHOLE PLANT IMAGES (9,612 IMAGES OF 392 SPECIES WITH AT LEAST 20 IMAGES PER SPECIES), IMAGES OF FLOWERS (3,384 IMAGES OF 271 SPECIES WITH AT LEAST 10 IMAGES PER SPECIES) AND SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY IMAGES OF LIVERWORT SPORES FROM FOSSOMBRONIA SPP. (322 IMAGES OF 12 SPECIES WITH AT LEAST 10 IMAGES PER SPECIES). TO DECREASE THE RISK OF OVERFITTING AND EXTEND THE TRAINING DATASET, DATA AUGMENTATION TECHNIQUES SUCH AS SCALING AND REFLECTION WERE TESTED TO IDENTIFY A HIGH PERFORMING METHOD, WHICH ALSO IMPROVED OVERALL MODEL PERFORMANCE. THE BEST PERFORMING MODEL FOR THE ALL-PLANTS (80.6% ACCURACY) AND FLOWER DATASETS (88.4% ACCURACY) WAS INCEPTION-V3 PRE-TRAINED ON THE INATURALIST DATASET OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS. FOR THE FOSSOMBRONIA SPP. DATASET, THE BEST PERFORMING MODEL (81.2% ACCURACY) WAS RESNET-V2-50 PRE-TRAINED ON IMAGENET 2012, USING THE 50-LAYER IMPLEMENTATION OF RESNET-V2. THE BEST PERFORMING FLOWER IDENTIFICATION MODEL WAS ALSO SHOWN TO HAVE SOME PROFICIENCY IN IDENTIFYING THE GENUS OF AN UNKNOWN SPECIES, WHERE THE GENUS BUT NOT SPECIES WAS REPRESENTED IN THE DATASET, WITH A TOP-5 ACCURACY OF 66%. THE FLOWER DATASET'S BEST MODEL PERFORMANCE WAS FURTHER TESTED USING 1,000 IMAGES (20 IMAGES OF 50 RANDOMLY SELECTED SPECIES) DOWNLOADED FROM THE ATLAS OF LIVING AUSTRALIA AND THE INTERNET WHICH PRODUCED A TOP-1 ACCURACY OF 85.9%. QUESTIONS THAT REMAIN TO BE ADDRESSED INCLUDE FURTHER TESTING OF DATA AUGMENTATION APPROACHES AND MORE COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS TO EXCLUDE OVERFITTING.

EACH SPECIES OF A WOOD HAS ITS OWN UNIQUE PATTERNS IN ITS BARK, WHICH ENABLED THE PROPOSED SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY IT ACCURATELY. AUTOMATIC WOOD RECOGNITION SYSTEM HAS NOT YET BEEN WELL ESTABLISHED MAINLY DUE TO LACK OF RESEARCH IN THIS AREA AND THE DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING THE WOOD DATABASE. IN OUR WORK, A WOOD RECOGNITION SYSTEM HAS BEEN DESIGNED BASED ON PRE-PROCESSING TECHNIQUES, FEATURE EXTRACTION AND BY CORRELATING THE FEATURES OF THOSE WOOD SPECIES FOR THEIR CLASSIFICATION. TEXTURE CLASSIFICATION IS A PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN STUDIED AND TESTED USING DIFFERENT METHODS DUE TO ITS VALUABLE USAGE IN VARIOUS PATTERN RECOGNITION PROBLEMS, SUCH AS WOOD RECOGNITION, ROCK CLASSIFICATION. THE MOST POPULAR TECHNIQUE USED FOR THE TEXTURAL CLASSIFICATION IS GRAY-LEVEL CO-OCCURRENCE MATRICES (GLCM). THE FEATURES FROM THE ENHANCED IMAGES ARE THUS EXTRACTED USING THE GLCM IS CORRELATED, WHICH DETERMINES THE CLASSIFICATION BETWEEN THE VARIOUS WOOD SPECIES.

"KALYANI A;SINGAMANENI R;PENUGONDA G";REMEMBRANCE OF MONOCOTYLEDONS USING RESIDUAL NETWORKS;PLANT IDENTIFICATION HAS SEVERAL APPLICATIONS IN THE AREA OF AGRICULTURE, ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY, HORTICULTURE. THERE ARE EXISTING SYSTEMS THAT IDENTIFY THE PLANT USING LEAF IMAGES. BECAUSE LEAVES ARE ONE OF A PLANT'S EASILY RECOGNIZABLE CHARACTERISTICS, THEY ARE FREQUENTLY USED FOR IDENTIFYING BY PREDICTION BASED MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS OR BY PERFORMING TRAIT SEGMENTATION BY EXTRACTING INFORMATION FROM PLANT'S LEAF. AS THE STRUCTURE AND FEATURES OF THE LEAF MAY BE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS STAGES OF LEAVES, DIFFERENT COLORS DURING STAGES, TORN LEAVES. SO INSTEAD OF USING A LEAF IMAGE, THE ENTIRE PLANT IMAGE IS A FAR MORE CONVINCING APPROACH. DATASET IS PREPARED BY IMAGES OF SOME MONOCOTS WHICH ARE COLLECTED MANUALLY. AS THE COUNT OF COLLECTED IMAGES IS LESS IN NUMBER, IMAGE AUGMENTATION IS USED TO GENERATE NEW IMAGES WITH DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES. A NEURAL NETWORK IS USED FOR FEATURE EXTRACTION AND TO IDENTIFY THE PLANT. AS THE IMAGE CONTAINS A LOT OF FEATURES NEEDED TO BE EXTRACTED, A NEURAL NETWORK IS NEEDED WHICH CAN BE SUITABLE FOR THIS SCENARIO. RESIDUAL NETWORKS (RESNET) IS A WORTHY APPROACH AS IT IS A WAY TO HANDLE THE VANISHING GRADIENT PROBLEM IN VERY DEEP CNNS. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM IS DEVELOPED USING RESNET-50 WHERE THE PRE-TRAINED WEIGHTS ARE IMPORTED AND THE MODEL IS TRAINED OVER THE PREPARED DATASET, WHERE THE MODEL RECOGNIZES THE RESPECTIVE SPECIES OF MONOCOT BY CAPTURING THE WHOLE IMAGE AND RESULTS IN ACHIEVING AN ACCURACY OF 99.3%.

FIRST, THE RECOGNITION RESULTS OF FOUR TYPES OF MODELS, NAMELY, YOLOV5, YOLOV3, FAST RCNN, AND SSD, WERE COMPARED. IT WAS FOUND THAT YOLOV5, WITH GUARANTEED RECOGNITION ACCURACY, HAD A RECOGNITION SPEED OF 4.7 MS/FRAME (ABOUT FOUR TIMES THAT OF THE SECOND RANKED YOLOV3). THEREFORE, THIS STUDY PRESENTS A NOVEL FRESH TEA LEAF SORTING SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES RAPID AND HIGH-PRECISION MULTI-CHANNEL SORTING FOR FOUR GRADES OF TEA LEAVES USING A TEA LEAF RECOGNITION MODEL BASED ON THE YOU ONLY LOOK ONCE (YOLOV5) DEEP LEARNING MODEL. SUBSEQUENTLY, A RAW DATASET, CONSISTING OF 6400 TARGET IMAGES OF DIFFERENT GRADES AND DIFFERENT MOISTURE CONTENTS, WAS USED TO EVALUATE THREE DIFFERENT OPTIMIZATION METHODS. AMONG THESE, THE STOCHASTIC GRADIENT DESCENT (SGD) OPTIMIZATION METHOD WAS FOUND TO PROVIDE THE BEST MODEL TRAINING RESULTS WITH AN AVERAGE RECOGNITION ACCURACY OF 98.2%. IN ADDITION, THE RECOGNITION EFFICACY OF THE RECOGNITION MODEL WAS FOUND TO BE POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE GRADIENT COVERAGE OF TEAâ€™S MOISTURE CONTENT IN THE TRAINING SET.

THE MAIN REASON IS THAT THE CLASSIFICATION PROCESS IS MANUAL, SLOW, AND ERROR-PRONE. MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES ARE PROMISING ALTERNATIVES FOR SUPPORTING HERBARIUM PLANTS IDENTIFICATION. THIS PAPER EVALUATES FEATURE EXTRACTION TECHNIQUES AND CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS TO IDENTIFY HERBARIUM SPECIMENS OF THE PIPERACEAE GISEKE FAMILY AT THE GENUS LEVEL. FOR THE EVALUATION, WE EXTRACTED A BALANCED SUBSET OF PRE-PROCESSED IMAGES FROM THE FIVE GENERA OF THE PIPERACEAE FAMILY (MANEKIA, OTTONIA, PEPEROMIA, PIPER, AND POTHOMORPHE) FROM THE SPECIESLINK REPOSITORY. OUR EXPERIMENTS POINT TO POTENTIAL SUPPORT IN IDENTIFYING OF HERBARIUM IMAGES OF THE PIPERACEAE FAMILY, MAINLY FOR THE GENERA MANEKIA, PEPEROMIA AND OTTONIA. THE BEST ACCURACY WAS 80.53% ACHIEVED BY COMBINING MOBILENET-V2 AND THE SVM CLASSIFIER.

"CHANG L;DING X";RESEARCH ON CLASSIFICATION AND RECOGNITION METHOD OF PLANT LEAVES BASED ON DEEP LEARNING;WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF GLOBAL SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND ECONOMY, THE COORDINATION OF SOCIAL RELATIONS AND ECOLOGICAL RELATIONS HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE SOLVED URGENTLY IN CONTEMPORARY DEVELOPMENT. TREE RESOURCES ARE THE FOUNDATION OF THE ECOSYSTEM. IN ORDER TO MAKE BETTER USE OF TREE RESOURCES AND IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES TAILORED TO LOCAL CONDITIONS, IT IS NECESSARY TO IDENTIFY THE TYPES OF TREES. DEEP LEARNING IS AN IMPORTANT METHOD TO DISTINGUISH TREE SPECIES BY ANALYZING LEAVES. DEEP LEARNING PROVIDES INCOMPARABLE ADVANTAGES OF TRADITIONAL OBJECT DETECTION METHODS FOR ACCURATELY EXTRACTING THE DEEP FEATURES AND CLASSIFICATION OF LEAF IMAGES. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE ACCURATE AND RAPID CLASSIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF PLANT LEAVES, THIS PAPER USES TWO NETWORK MODELS, YOLOV5 NETWORK AND IMAGE RECOGNITION RESNET-50 BASED ON FASTER REGIONS WITH CONVOLUTIONAL (FASTER-RCNN), TO MAKE A COMPARATIVE STUDY ON THE CONSTRUCTED 10 TYPES OF COMMON PLANT LEAF DATASETS. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT YOLOV5 NETWORK CAN QUICKLY AND ACCURATELY IDENTIFY PLANT LEAVES, AND ITS LIGHTWEIGHT MODEL CAN BE EASILY DEPLOYED ON MOBILE TERMINALS. FASTER-RCNN NETWORK MODEL CAN ACCURATELY EXTRACT THE MULTI-LAYER FEATURE IMAGES OF PLANT LEAVES TO OBTAIN A AVERAGE ACCURACY THAT IS 1.1% HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE YOLOV5, BUT THE RECOGNITION SPEED IS SLOWER. IT CAN BE USED FOR FINE CLASSIFICATION AND LEAF IDENTIFICATION IN SUBSEQUENT PLANT EXPERIMENTS.

HOWEVER, THERE ARE FEW CHANNEL ATTENTION METHODS FOR LEAF DISEASE DETECTION. FACING THE PROBLEM OF LEAF DISEASE IMAGE RECOGNITION UNDER THE ACTUAL BACKGROUND, THESE METHODS HAVE NOT MADE ADAPTIVE IMPROVEMENT AND ADJUSTMENT, WHICH LEADS TO THE DIFFICULTY OF FEATURE EXTRACTION OF LEAVES KEY AREAS.IN ORDER TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM, A MULTI-KERNEL-SIZE EFFICIENT CHANNEL ATTENTION CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK(MKS-ECANET) IS PROPOSED. FIRSTLY, THE IRNET WITH THE INVERTED RESIDUAL AS THE BASIC STRUCTURE IS CONSTRUCTED AS THE BASIC NETWORK FOR ADDING THE ATTENTION MODULE,WHICH IS USED TO OBTAIN THE RICH FEATURE REPRESENTATION OF LEAF LESIONS; SECONDLY, A MULTI-KERNEL-SIZE EFFICIENT CHANNEL ATTENTION MODULE (MKS-ECA) IS PROPOSED, WHICH USE A COMBINATION OF ONE-DIMENSIONAL CONVOLUTIONS OF DIFFERENT SIZES TO INCREASE THE INFORMATION INTERACTION BETWEEN DIFFERENT CHANNELS. FINALLY, WE CONSTRUCT MKS-ECANET BY ADDING THE MKS-ECA MODULE TO IRNET IN A SUITABLE WAY, AND CONDUCT EXPERIMENTS ON THE APPLE LEAF DATASET IN THE ACTUAL BACKGROUND. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE ACCURACY OF MKS-ECANET IS 95.6%, THE PARAMETER IS 1.2M, AND THE FLOPS IS 403M. COMPARED WITH MOBLIENETV2 AND ECANET, THE ACCURACY OF MKS-ECANET IS IMPROVED BY ABOUT 5% AND 3% RESPECTIVELY.

THE CNNS AND ITS VARIANTS SUCH AS RCNN HAVE RECENTLY BECOME A POPULAR METHOD OF PLANT FEATURE RECOGNITION DUE TO THEIR SUPERIOR ABILITY TO CLASSIFY, DETECT, AND LABEL FEATURES WITH HIGH FIDELITY. ANREDERA CORDIFOLIA, ALSO KNOWN AS MADEIRA VINE, IS A PLANT SPECIES THAT UNNECESSARILY INVADE ENVIRONMENTS, HENCE DESTROYING THE PLANTS OCCUPYING THOSE ENVIRONMENTS. HERE, WE DEVELOP A COMPUTER VISION MODEL FOR THE DETECTION OF ANREDERA CORDIFOLIA WITH MASK-RCNN FOR USE IN ENVIRONMENTS THAT MAY NEED DRONES TO DETECT THE PRESENCE OF THIS FOREIGN PLANT SPECIES. TO OPTIMIZE THE MODEL'S CONFIDENCE IN DETECTING THE PRESENCE OF THE ANREDERA CORDIFOLIA, A MASK-RCNN WAS TRAINED WITH IMAGES OF THE ANREDERA CORDIFOLIA USING THREE DISTINCT FEATURES OF THIS PLANT AS OBJECT CLASSES. THESE FEATURES THAT WERE USED TO BUILD CLASSES OF THE MASK-RCNN WERE LEAVES, FLOWERS, AND THE TUBERS. THIS NOVEL APPROACH ENSURES THE DETECTION OF THE ANREDERA CORDIFOLIA AS THE PROMINENT FEATURES WERE USED AS CLASS OBJECTS OF THE MASK-RCNN. THE RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT THE MASK- RCNN WAS ABLE TO OVERLAY MASKS AND BOUNDING BOXES AROUND THE ANREDERA CORDIFOLIA FEATURES THAT WERE DETECTED.

THE MOST IMPORTANT AND CRUCIAL PHASE IN PLANT IDENTIFICATION IS THE PHASE OF FEATURE EXTRACTION. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A METHOD OF SHAPE FEATURE EXTRACTION THAT IS SCALE INVARIANT FEATURE TRANSFORM (SIFT) AND COLOUR FEATURE EXTRACTION GRID BASED COLOUR MOMENT (GBCM) TO IDENTIFY PLANT. FORTY PLANT SPECIES IMAGES WERE COLLECTED FROM THEIR NATURAL HABITATS AND CAPTURED UNDER VARIOUS TIME OF THE DAY. THESE PLANT IMAGES ARE THEN USED AS GROUND TRUTH IMAGES. THESE IMAGES ARE FURTHER ROTATED AND SCALED TO PRODUCE ANOTHER FORTY TEST IMAGES. THE EXTRACTED FEATURES OF THE TEST IMAGES ARE THEN IDENTIFIED BY CALCULATING THEIR EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE (ED) AGAINST THE GROUND TRUTH AND ACHIEVED IDENTIFICATION ACCURACY RATE OF 87.5 PERCENT.

THIS STEMS FROM THE NO FREE LUNCH WHICH STATES THAT UNIVERSAL APPROACH THAT COULD RENDER SATISFYING RESULTS FOR ALL PRACTICAL CHALLENGES DOES NOT EXIST. THEREFORE, IN THIS RESEARCH A NOVEL MULTI-SWARM FIREFLY ALGORITHM, THAT TRIES TO ADDRESS FLAWS OF ORIGINAL FIREFLY METAHEURISTICS, IS PROPOSED. DEVISED ALGORITHM IS APPLIED TO INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT PRACTICAL CHALLENGE OF PLANTS CLASSIFICATION, AS PART OF THE HYBRID FRAMEWORK BETWEEN MACHINE LEARNING AND OPTIMIZATION METAHEURISTICS. FOR THIS PURPOSE, A SET OF 1,000 RANDOM IMAGES OF HEALTHY LEAVES, FROM ONE PUBLIC REPOSITORY, IS RETRIEVED FOR THE FOLLOWING PLANTS: APPLE, CHERRY, PEPPER AND TOMATO. HYBRID FRAMEWORK INCLUDES PRE-PROCESSING, CONSTRUCTING BAG OF FEATURES AND CLASSIFICATION STEPS. AFTER PRE-PROCESSING, A BAG OF FEATURES IS CONSTRUCTED BY UTILIZING WELL-KNOWN SCALE-INVARIANT FEATURE TRANSFORM ALGORITHM, K-MEANS-BASED VOCABULARY GENERATION AND HISTOGRAM. SUCH IMAGES ARE THEN CATEGORIZED WITH SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE CLASSIFIER. HOWEVER, TO OBTAIN SATISFYING RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR DATASET, THE SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES HYPER-PARAMETERSâ€™ NEED TO BE TUNED AND IN THE PROPOSED RESEARCH MULTI-SWARM FIREFLY ALGORITHM IS EMPLOYED TO DETERMINE OPTIMAL (SUB-OPTIMAL) HYPER-PARAMETERSâ€™ VALUES FOR THIS PRACTICAL CHALLENGE. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WITH THE BASIC FIREFLY METAHEURISTICS AND OTHER WELL-KNOWN SWARM INTELLIGENCE ALGORITHMS WAS CONDUCTED TO ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED METHOD IN TERMS OF PRECISION, RECALL, F-SCORE FOR THIS MULTI-CLASS CLASSIFICATION CHALLENGE. OBTAINED RESULTS SHOW SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS OF DEVISED METHOD OVER THE ORIGINAL FIREFLY ALGORITHM AND ALSO BETTER METRICS THAN OTHER STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNIQUES IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES.

"TAIB M;NAZAR N;SULAIMAN H;HALIM S";PIPER BETLE AND PIPER SARMENTOSUM IDENTIFICATION USING SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE;PLANT IDENTIFICATION IS AN IMPORTANT TASK FOR BIOLOGISTS, CHEMISTS, SCIENTISTS AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS TO IDENTIFY EVERY PLANT SPECIES IN THE WORLD FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. HOWEVER, THE PROCESS OF PLANTS IDENTIFICATION IS USUALLY VERY TIME CONSUMING AND LOW EFFICIENCY TO IDENTIFY BETWEEN PLANTS THAT ARE ALMOST IDENTICAL TO EACH OTHER ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF SHAPE. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY ARE TO EXTRACT THE FEATURES PROPERTIES AND TO IDENTIFY THE PIPER BETLE AND PIPER SARMENTOSUM USING SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM). THESE TWO TYPES OF PLANTS ARE IDENTICAL TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE THEY COME FROM THE SAME FAMILY THAT IS PIPERACEAE. THE IMAGE OF PIPER BETLE AND PIPER SARMENTOSUM LEAVES ARE USED AS THE DATA TO EXTRACT THEIR FEATURES USING IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES. THE FEATURES EXTRACTION PROPERTIES FROM THE LEAF SUCH AS AREA, PERIMETER, CONVEX HULL, MAJOR AXIS, MINOR AXIS AND THE RATIO OF AXES ARE CALCULATED AND EXTRACTED USING MATLAB. THE CLASSIFICATION METHOD OF SVMUSED THE EXTRACTED FEATURES TO FIND THE BEST POSSIBLE HYPERPLANE THAT CAN IDENTIFY AND CLASSIFY BETWEEN THESE TWO TYPES OF PLANTS. BESIDES, THE OPTIMIZATION VALUE OF THE BOX CONSTRAINT AND KERNEL SCALE ALSO BEEN MEASURED AUTOMATICALLY BY USING THE FUNCTION CODE IN IMAGE PROCESSING TOOLBOX. THE RESULT DEMONSTRATED THAT THE SUCCESSFUL RATE OF PLANT IDENTIFICATION OF PIPER BETLE AND PIPER SARMENTOSUM IS UP TO 80% USING SVM METHOD.

"CHOMPOOKHAM T;GONWIRAT S;LATA S;PHIPHIPHATPHAISIT S;SURINTA O";PLANT LEAF IMAGE RECOGNITION USING MULTIPLEGRID BASED LOCAL DESCRIPTOR AND DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION APPROACH;THE IDENTIFICATION PROCESS OF PLANT SPECIES IS ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT AND CHALLENGING PROBLEMS. IN THIS RESEARCH AREA, MANY RESEARCHERS HAVE FOCUSED ON IDENTIFYING THE PLANT LEAF IMAGES BECAUSE THE LEAVES OF A PLANT ARE FOUND ALMOST ALL YEAR ROUND. THE ACHIEVE METHOD OF THE PLANT LEAF IMAGE RECOGNITION IS BASED ON UNIQUE EXTRACTION FEATURES FROM THE PLANT LEAF AND USING THE WELL-KNOWN MACHINE LEARNINGS AS A CLASSIFICATION METHOD. AS A RESULT, RECOGNITION ACCURACY WAS OFTEN NOT VERY HIGH. IN ORDER TO IMPROVE RECOGNITION ACCURACY, WE PROPOSED A MULTIPLE GRIDS TECHNIQUE BASED ON THE LOCAL DESCRIPTORS AND DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION. FIRSTLY, WE DIVIDED THE PLANT LEAF IMAGE ACCORDING TO GRID SIZE AND CALCULATED THE LOCAL DESCRIPTORS FROM EACH GRID. SECONDLY, THE DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION IS PROPOSED TO TRANSFORM AND DECREASE THE CORRELATED VARIABLES OF THE FEATURE VECTOR. FINALLY, THE FEATURE VECTOR WITH A RELATIVELY LOW-DIMENSIONAL IS TRANSFERRED TO THE MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES, WHICH ARE THE SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE AND MULTI-LAYER PERCEPTRON ALGORITHMS. WE HAVE EVALUATED AND COMPARED THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM WITH THE BAG OF VISUAL WORDS METHOD AND THE DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (INCLUDING ALEXNET AND GOOGLENET ARCHITECTURES) ON THE FOLIO LEAF IMAGE DATASET.

"CHOMPOOKHAM T;SURINTA O";ENSEMBLE METHODS WITH DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS FOR PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION;RECOGNITION OF PLANT LEAVES AND DISEASES FROM IMAGES IS A CHALLENGING TASK IN COMPUTER VISION AND MACHINE LEARNING. THIS IS BECAUSE VARIOUS PROBLEMS DIRECTLY AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SYSTEM, SUCH AS THE LEAF STRUCTURE, DIFFERENCES OF THE INTRA-CLASS, SIMILARITY OF SHAPE BETWEEN INTER-CLASS, PERSPECTIVE OF THE IMAGE, AND EVEN RECORDING TIME. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE THE ENSEMBLE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) METHOD TO TACKLE THESE ISSUES AND IMPROVE PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION PERFORMANCE. WE TRAINED FIVE CNN MODELS: MOBILENETV1, MOBILENETV2, NASNETMOBILE, DENSENET121, AND XCEPTION, ACCORDINGLY TO DISCOVER THE BEST CNN BASED MODEL. ENSEMBLE METHODS, UNWEIGHTED AVERAGE, WEIGHTED AVERAGE, AND UNWEIGHTED MAJORITY VOTE METHODS WERE THEN APPLIED TO THE CNN OUTPUT PROBABILITIES OF EACH MODEL. WE HAVE EVALUATED THESE ENSEMBLE CNN METHODS ON A MULBERRY LEAF DATASET AND TWO LEAF DISEASE DATASETS: TOMATO AND CORN LEAF DISEASE. AS A RESULT, THE INDIVIDUAL CNN MODEL SHOWS THAT MOBILENETV2 OUTPERFORMS EVERY CNN MODEL WITH AN ACCURACY OF 91.19% ON THE MULBERRY LEAF DATASET. THE XCEPTION COMBINED WITH DATA AUGMENTATION TECHNIQUES (HEIGHT SHIFT+VERTICAL FLIP+FILL MODE) OBTAINS AN ACCURACY OF 91.77%. WE ACHIEVED VERY HIGH ACCURACY ABOVE 99% FROM THE DENSENET121 AND XCEPTION MODELS ON THE LEAF DISEASE DATASETS. FOR THE ENSEMBLE CNNS METHOD, WE SELECTED THE BASED MODELS ACCORDING TO THE BEST CNN MODELS AND PREDICTED THE OUTPUT OF EACH CNN WITH THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE ENSEMBLE METHOD. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT 3-ENSEMBLE CNNS (3-ENSCNNS) PERFORMED BETTER ON PLANT LEAF DISEASE DATASETS, WHILE 5-ENSCNNS OUTPERFORMS ON THE MULBERRY LEAF DATASET. SURPRISINGLY, THE DATA AUGMENTATION TECHNIQUE DID NOT AFFECT THE ENSEMBLE CNNS ON THE MULBERRY LEAF AND CORN LEAF DISEASE DATASETS. ON THE OTHER HAND, APPLICATION OF DATA AUGMENTATION WAS SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN WITHOUT ONLY ON THE TOMATO LEAF DISEASE DATASET. Â© 2021 ICIC INTERNATIONAL.

TRADITIONAL CROP MONITORING METHODS ARE TIME-CONSUMING AND LABORIOUS. THE PITAYA TREE, ONE OF THE CHARACTERISTIC ECONOMIC CROPS IN THE COMPLEX MOUNTAIN ENVIRONMENT, WAS SELECTED AS THE RESEARCH OBJECT. CONSIDERING THE COMPREHENSIVE FACTORS SUCH AS DIFFERENT SEASONS, CLOUD SHADOW SHADING, CROP INTERPLANTING, STEEP TERRAIN, DIFFERENT BREEDS, AND AGES OF PITAYA TREES, THE QUAD-ROTOR UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES (UAVS) WERE USED TO COLLECT THE VISIBLE LIGHT IMAGES OF THE PLANTING BASE OF PITAYA TREES IN THE TEST AREA IN KARST PLATEAU CANYON REGION AND THE VERIFICATION AREA IN A COMPLEX ENVIRONMENT. FIRST, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RGB VALUES OF THE EIGHT MAIN GROUND OBJECTS IN THE TEST AREAS ARE ANALYZED ACCORDING TO THE COLOR INDEX, GEOMETRIC SIZE, AND TEXTURE CHARACTERISTICS, WHICH SHOW THAT PITAYA PLANTS, WEEDS, AND SHRUBS HAVE CERTAIN INTERFERENCE WITH EACH OTHER. THEN THE EXCESS GREEN INDEX (EXG) OF THE IMAGES IS CALCULATED TO ENHANCE THE VEGETATION CHARACTERISTICS AND SEPARATE VEGETATION AND NON-VEGETATION. GAUSSIAN HIGH-PASS FILTER (GHPF) IS USED TO RETAIN THE HIGH-FREQUENCY INFORMATION OF PITAYA PLANTS ON THE EXG IMAGES. AFTER GHPF PROCESSING, THE DN VALUES OF SHRUB AND WEEDS ARE REDUCED, THE EDGES OF THE AREA TARGET ARE ENHANCED, AND THE INFLUENCES OF WEEDS AND CLOUD SHADOWS ON PLANT IDENTIFICATION ARE ELIMINATED. FINALLY, THROUGH FIELD MEASUREMENT OF PITAYA PLANT DATA AND OTSU, GRAYSCALE SEGMENTATION WAS PERFORMED ON THE IMAGES PROCESSED BY GHPF AND THE PITAYA PLANT INFORMATION WAS EXTRACTED. COMBINED WITH THE PROJECTION AREA OF SINGLE PITAYA TREE, THE NUMBER OF PITAYA TREES WAS OBTAINED BY AREA SCREENING METHOD. THE TARGET DETECTION PERCENTAGE OF TEST AREA A, TEST AREA B, AND THE VERIFICATION AREA IN COMPLEX ENVIRONMENT IS, RESPECTIVELY, 96.99\%, 94.66\%, AND 94.30\%; THE QUALITY PERCENTAGE OF THEM IS, RESPECTIVELY, 92.46\%, 90.41\% AND 91.50\%; THE BRANCHING FACTOR OF THEM IS, RESPECTIVELY, 0.05, 0.05, AND 0.03, PROVING THAT THE RGB IMAGES COLLECTED BY UAV CAN BE USED IN THE RECOGNITION AND COUNTING OF PITAYA TREES IN COMPLEX MOUNTAIN ENVIRONMENTS.

"CHULIF S;LEE S;CHANG Y";A GLOBALSCALE PLANT IDENTIFICATION USING DEEP LEARNING NEUON SUBMISSION TO PLANTCLEF 2022;WITH THE INCREASING KNOWLEDGE OF PLANTS GLOBALLY, IT IS BECOMING DIFFICULT FOR HUMAN EXPERTS TO IDENTIFY PLANTS MANUALLY AND SYSTEMATICALLY. VASCULAR PLANTS ALONE ARE ESTIMATED TO BE MORE THAN 300,000 SPECIES. HOWEVER, DEEP LEARNING METHODS HAVE RECENTLY MADE PROGRESS IN AUTOMATING PLANT IDENTIFICATION. THE PLANTCLEF 2022 CHALLENGE THIS YEAR AIMS TO TACKLE THE PROBLEMS FACED IN GLOBAL PLANT IDENTIFICATION. WITH THE AGGREGATION OF VARIOUS DATA FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES, IT IS A REAL PROBLEM TO DEAL WITH BIG DATA CONSISTING OF MANY CLASSES, UNBALANCED CLASSES, INACCURACIES, DUPLICATIONS, AND A DIVERSITY OF VISUAL CONTENTS AND QUALITY. GIVEN A TRAINING DATASET OF 4 MILLION IMAGES AND 80,000 SPECIES, THE TASK OF THE CHALLENGE WAS TO IDENTIFY THE CORRECT PLANT SPECIES FROM 26,868 MULTI-IMAGE PLANT OBSERVATIONS. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE SUBMISSIONS MADE BY OUR TEAM TO PLANTCLEF 2022. WE TRAINED SEVERAL DEEP LEARNING MODELS BASED ON THE INCEPTION-V4 AND INCEPTION-RESNET-V2 ARCHITECTURES. THE TYPES OF NETWORKS CONSTRUCTED WERE A SINGLE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) AND A TRIPLET NETWORK. THEY WERE EITHER INITIALISED ON WEIGHTS PRE-TRAINED FROM THE IMAGENET DATASET OR THE WEIGHTS PRE-TRAINED FROM PLANTCLEF 2022 DATASET. ALTHOUGH WE INTENDED TO COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE BETWEEN OUR SINGLE CNN AND TRIPLET MODELS, UNFORTUNATELY, WE DID NOT MANAGE TO OBTAIN THE COMPLETE RESULTS DUE TO RESOURCE AND TIME CONSTRAINTS. NEVERTHELESS, WE SUBMITTED NINE RUNS AND OUR BEST SUBMISSION ACHIEVED A MACRO AVERAGED MEAN RECIPROCAL RANK SCORE OF 0.6078, PLACING 4TH AMONG THE 45 SUBMITTED RUNS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE SHOWN THAT WEB OR NOISY DATA DOES IMPROVE GENERALISATION IN THE IDENTIFICATION. MOREOVER, THE ENSEMBLE OF MODELS FROM DIFFERENT NETWORK ARCHITECTURES, I.E., INCEPTION-V4 AND INCEPTION-RESNET-V2, GIVE HIGHER ACCURACY THAN A SINGLE MODEL.

"CHULIF S;LEE S;CHANG Y;CHAI K";A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR CROSSDOMAIN PLANT IDENTIFICATION USING HERBARIUM SPECIMENS;THE PRESERVATION OF PLANT SPECIMENS IN HERBARIA HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT FOR CENTURIES IN EFFORTS TO STUDY AND CONFIRM PLANT TAXA. WITH THE INCREASING COLLECTION OF HERBARIA MADE AVAILABLE DIGITALLY, IT IS PRACTICAL TO USE HERBARIUM SPECIMENS FOR THE AUTOMATION OF PLANT IDENTIFICATION. THEY ARE ALSO SUBSTANTIALLY MORE ACCESSIBLE AND LESS EXPENSIVE TO OBTAIN COMPARED TO FIELD IMAGES. IN FACT, IN REMOTE AND INACCESSIBLE HABITATS, FIELD IMAGES OF RARE PLANT SPECIES ARE STILL IMMENSELY LACKING. AS A RESULT, RARE PLANT SPECIES IDENTIFICATION IS CHALLENGING DUE TO THE DEFICIENCY OF TRAINING DATA. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, WE INVESTIGATE A CROSS-DOMAIN ADAPTATION APPROACH THAT ALLOWS KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER FROM A MODEL LEARNED FROM HERBARIUM SPECIMENS TO FIELD IMAGES. WE PROPOSE A MODEL CALLED HERBARIUMâ€“FIELD TRIPLET LOSS NETWORK (HFTL NETWORK) TO LEARN THE MAPPING BETWEEN HERBARIUM AND FIELD DOMAINS. SPECIFICALLY, THE MODEL IS TRAINED TO MAXIMIZE THE EMBEDDING DISTANCE OF DIFFERENT PLANT SPECIES AND MINIMIZE THE EMBEDDING DISTANCE OF THE SAME PLANT SPECIES GIVEN HERBARIUMâ€“FIELD PAIRS. THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE IMPLEMENTATION AND PERFORMANCE OF THE HFTL NETWORK TO ASSESS THE HERBARIUMâ€“FIELD SIMILARITY OF PLANTS. IT CORRESPONDS TO THE CROSS-DOMAIN PLANT IDENTIFICATION CHALLENGE IN PLANTCLEF 2020 AND PLANTCLEF 2021. DESPITE THE LACK OF FIELD IMAGES, OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE NETWORK CAN GENERALIZE AND IDENTIFY RARE SPECIES.

"DESAI V;SAVANI V;PATEL R";PLANT CLASSIFICATION BASED ON LEAVES USING ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK;ABSTRACT: MANUAL METHODS TO EXAMINE LEAF FOR PLANT CLASSIFICATION CAN BE TEDIOUS, THEREFORE, AUTOMATION IS DESIRED. EXISTING METHODS TRY DISTINCTIVE APPROACHES TO ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK. NOWADAYS, CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORKS (CNN) ARE WIDELY USED FOR SUCH APPLICATION WHICH ACHIEVES HIGHER ACCURACY. HOWEVER, CNN'S ARE COMPUTATIONALLY EXPENSIVE AND REQUIRE EXTENSIVE DATASET FOR TRAINING. OTHER EXISTING METHODS ARE FAR LESS RESOURCE EXPENSIVE BUT THEY ALSO HAVE THEIR SHORTCOMINGS FOR EXAMPLE, SOME FEATURES CANNOT BE PROCESSED ACCURATELY WITH AUTOMATION, SOME NECESSARY DIFFERENTIATORS ARE LEFT OUT. TO OVERCOME THIS, WE HAVE PROPOSED A SIMPLE ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK (ANN) FOR AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION OF PLANTS BASED ON THEIR LEAF FEATURES. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM ABLE TO ACHIEVE AN ACCURACY OF 96% BY INCORPORATING ONLY A SINGLE HIDDEN LAYER OF ANN.

"DEVI M;ARUNA R;RAJESWARI D;MANOGNA R";CONV2D XCEPTION ADADELTA GRADIENT DESCENT LEARNING RATE DEEP LEARNING OPTIMIZER FOR PLANT SPECIES CLASSIFICATION;ALMOST EVERY ELEMENT OF LIVING BEINGS IS UNDERGOING EXTRAORDINARY TRANSFORMATION AS A RESULT OF TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES. WHILE MANY AREAS OF AGRICULTURE ARE LEVERAGING CUTTING-EDGE TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS, FARMING REMAINS FAR BEHIND IN ADOPTING THESE ADVANCEMENTS. AYURVEDIC MEDICINE AND OTHER PLANT-BASED MEDICAL SYSTEMS EMPLOY THE CLASSIFICATION OF PLANTS BY THEIR LEAFLETS FOR A VARIETY OF PURPOSES, INCLUDING ECOSYSTEM, FARMING, DISEASE DIAGNOSIS, RARE PLANT MAINTENANCE, AND HERBAL REMEDIES. DUE TO THE UTILIZATION OF BIOLOGICAL NOMENCLATURE, STANDARD METHODS OF PLANT RECOGNITION AND CLASSIFICATION ARE DIFFICULT, TIME-CONSUMING, AND AGGRAVATING FOR NON-EXPERTS. FOR LEARNERS WHO ARE SEEKING TO LEARN ABOUT SPECIES, THIS POSES A REAL CHALLENGE. BASED ON THIS CONSEQUENCE, THIS PAPER RECOMMENDS CONV2D XCEPTION ADADELTA GRADIENT DESCENT (CXAGD) DEEP LEARNING TO CLASSIFY THE PLANT SPECIES BASED ON THE LEAFLET FEATURE STRUCTURE. THE PROPOSED CXAGD MODEL USES LEAF CLASSIFICATION DATASET FROM KAGGLE WITH 4500 PLANT LEAFLETS OF VARIOUS SPECIES. ONE INPUT, A DENSE AVERAGE POOLING LAYER, AND AN OUTPUT LAYER WERE USED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROPOSED CONV2D ADADELTA GRADIENT DEEP CNN MODEL. THE CXAGD MODEL WAS CONSTRUCTED USING 36 DEPTH WISE SEPARABLE CONVOLUTIONAL LAYERS AND A MAXIMUM POOLING LAYER FOR EACH CONVOLUTION AND TRAINED WITH LEARNING RATE OF ADADELTA OPTIMIZER. THE CXAGD BUILT WITH XCEPTION NETWORK WITH THE ADADELTA OPTIMIZER WITH THE DROPOUT OF 0.5, WEIGHT DECAY OF L2 REGULARIZATION. THE LEAF DATASET SUBJECTED TO THE TRAINING AND TESTING DATA DIVISION AND THE TRAINING DATA APPLIED TO CXAGD MODEL AND ALSO APPLIED TO OTHER CNN MODELS FOR COMPARING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE PROPOSED CXAGD MODEL. PYTHON WAS USED FOR PROGRAMMING, WITH A BATCH SIZE OF 64 AND 30 TRAINING EPOCHS, ON A GEFORCE TESLA V100 GRAPHICS CARD SERVER. IMPLEMENTATION OUTCOMES PROJECTS THAT PROPOSED CXAGD MODEL EXHIBITS ACCURACY OF 97.85%, PRECISION OF 97.42%, RECALL OF 97.75% AND FSCORE OF 97.76% WHEN COMPARED WITH EXISTING CNN MODELS.

THE IDENTIFICATION OF LEAVES IS ESSENTIAL DUE TO THE INCREASED AUTOMATION OCCURRING IN BOTH THE COMMERCIAL AND MEDICAL SECTORS. TYPICALLY, PHYSICAL OR GENETIC TRAITS ARE USED TO IDENTIFY LEAVES. HOWEVER, CLASSIFYING THE MANY LEAF CULTIVARS IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE COMPLICATED DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF MORPHOLOGICAL VARIATIONS AMONG THEM. SINCE THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL EVOLUTIONARY CHANGES OVER THE PRECEDING FEW DECADES, THERE ARE CURRENTLY MORE VARIETIES OF A CERTAIN LEAF TYPE. THUS IT TAKES TIME TO MANUALLY SORT AND IDENTIFY THESE LEAVES.

IDENTIFYING AN UNKNOWN PLANT SPECIES IS NOT A SIMPLE TASK. AUTOMATIC IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES BASED ON LEAVES RECOGNITION CAN HELP TO FIND THE BEST FEATURES USEFUL FOR PLANT REPRESENTATION AND CLASSIFICATION. MANY METHODS PRESENT IN LITERATURE USE ONLY A SMALL AND COMPLEX SET OF FEATURES, OFTEN EXTRACTED FROM THE BINARY IMAGES OR THE BOUNDARY OF THE LEAF. IN THIS WORK WE PROPOSE A LEAF RECOGNITION METHOD WHICH USES A NEW FEATURES SET THAT INCORPORATES SHAPE, COLOR AND TEXTURE FEATURES. A TOTAL OF 138 FEATURES ARE EXTRACTED AND USED FOR TRAINING A SVM MODEL. THE METHOD HAS BEEN TESTED ON FLAVIA DATASET (WU ET AL., 2007), SHOWING EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE BOTH IN TERMS OF ACCURACY THAT OFTEN REACHES 100%, AND IN TERMS OF SPEED, LESS THAN A SECOND TO PROCESS AND EXTRACT FEATURES FROM AN IMAGE.

"GRACELIN S;RAIMOND K";DEEP LEARNING BASED INDIGENOUS HERBAL MEDICINAL PLANTS RECOGNITION A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW;IN THIS MODERN MEDICINAL WORLD, NUMEROUS MEDICINES WITH VARIOUS CHEMICAL COMPOSITIONS HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED. MANY INDIVIDUALS CONSUME THEM THESE DAYS BECAUSE THEY ARE QUICK IN HEALING. HOWEVER, THEY HAVE A VARIETY OF DRAWBACKS, INCLUDING THE FAILURE OF INTERNAL ORGANS, WHICH MAY EVEN LEAD TO DEMISE. AS A RESULT, SOME ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT THAT IS BOTH EFFECTIVE AND FREE OF ADVERSE EFFECTS IS REQUIRED. MEDICINAL HERBS HAVE BEEN UTILIZED TO CURE PRACTICALLY EVERY DISEASE SINCE ANCIENT TIMES. IT IS QUITE EFFECTIVE, AND IT IS ALSO FREE OF SIDE EFFECTS. NOWADAYS, MACHINE LEARNING (ML) AND DEEP LEARNING (DL) ALGORITHMS ARE USED FREQUENTLY TO SOLVE MANY REAL-TIME PROBLEMS. THEY PREDICT RESULTS WITH MUCH ACCURACY. IN THIS PAPER, A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW IS DEVISED FOR IDENTIFYING THERAPEUTIC PLANTS USING ML AND DL MODELS. THE PERFORMANCE OF VARIOUS MODELS AS WELL AS THE FEATURES USED BY EACH MODEL IS COMPARED TO CHOOSE THE BEST PERFORMING MODEL.

"BERIHU M;FANG J;LU S";AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION OF MEDICINAL PLANTS OF LEAF IMAGES BASED ON CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK;"PLANTS ARE THE BASIS OF ALL LIVING THINGS ON EARTH, SUPPLYING US WITH OXYGEN, FOOD, SHELTER, MEDICINE, AND PRESERVING THE PLANET FROM DAM-AGES THAT COULD FACE CLIMATE CHANGES. CONCERNING THEIR MEDICINAL ABILITIES, LIMITED ACCESS TO PROPER MEDICAL CENTERS IN MANY RURAL AREAS AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES MADE TRADITIONAL MEDICINE PREFERABLE BY THE COMMUNITY. IN ADDITION, THEIR LOWER SIDE EFFECT AND AFFORDABILITY ALSO PLAYS A BIG ROLE. MORE THAN HALF OF THE POPULATION USES MEDICINAL PLANTS DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY FOR ANIMALS AND PERSONAL USE IN ETHIOPIA. HOWEVER, ACCURATE MEDICINAL PLANT IDENTIFICATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR MANUAL IDENTIFICATION AND AUTOMATIC RECOGNITION SYSTEMS MAINLY BECAUSE THE KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER BETWEEN THE KNOWLEDGE HOLDERS (TRADITIONAL PHYSICIANS, ELDERLY) AND MODERN SCIENCE HAVE A HUGE GAP. SEVERAL STUDIES ADDRESSED AN AUTOMATIC PLANT RECOGNITION SYSTEM USING DIFFERENT FEATURE EXTRACTION METHODS AND CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS. IN THIS PAPER, A NOVEL DATASET, WHICH WAS BASED ON ETHIOPIAN MEDICINAL PLANTS, THAT USE THE LEAF PART OF THE PLANT, AS A MEDICINE WAS USED TO AUTOMATICALLY CLASSIFY THE PLANTS ACCORDINGLY USING THEIR LEAF IMAGE. AN ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE TO COLLECT LEAF IMAGES OF MEDICINAL PLANTS IN ETHIOPIA, TO TRAIN, TEST COLLECTED DATASET IMAGES, AND CLASSIFY THOSE IMAGES USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK MODELS LIKE GOOGLENET AND ALEXNET. THE PROPOSED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS WERE FINE-TUNED WITH THE ADJUSTMENT OF HYPER-PARAMETERS LIKE LEARNING RATE, THE NUMBER OF EPOCHS, OPTIMIZERS TO THE MODELS. IMAGE AUGMENTATION IS ALSO IMPLEMENTED TO ENLARGE THE DATASET. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULT FOR THE AUGMENTED DATASET AND MORE TRAINING EPOCH GAVE BETTER PERFORMANCE AND ACCURACY IN THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE IMAGES. FROM THE TWO SELECTED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK MODELS, THE BEST MODEL IS THEN DETERMINED BASED ON THE RESULT IN ACCURACY AND LOSS; FROM AN EXPERIMENT CONDUCTED, THE BEST MODEL, WHICH IS GOOGLENET WITH AN ACCURACY OF 96.7 % CHOSEN TO DEVELOP A WEB-BASED AUTOMATIC MEDICINAL PLANT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM.

"DUDI B;RAJESH V";MEDICINAL PLANT RECOGNITION BASED ON CNN AND MACHINE LEARNING;IN THE RECENT DAYS AUTOMATED PLANT SPECIES RECOGNITION SYSTEMS ARE DEVELOPED TO HELP THE ORDINARY PEOPLE IN IDENTIFICATION OF THE DIFFERENT SPECIES. BUT THE AUTOMATIC ANALYSIS OF PLANT SPECIES BY THE COMPUTER IS DIFFICULT AS COMPARED TO THE HUMAN INTERPRETATION. THE RESEARCH HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT IN THIS FIELD FOR THE BETTER RECOGNITION OF PLANT SPECIES. STILL THESE APPROACHES LACK WITH EXACT CLASSIFICATION OF THE PLANT SPECIES. THE PROBLEM IS DUE TO THE INAPPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM. ESPECIALLY WHEN WE CONSIDER THE RECOGNITION OF MEDICINAL PLANT SPECIES, THE ACCURACY WILL BE THE PRIMARY CRITERIA. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM IN THIS RESEARCH ADOPTS THE DEEP LEARNING METHOD TO OBTAIN THE HIGH ACCURACY IN CLASSIFICATION AND RECOGNITION PROCESS USING COMPUTER VISION TECHNIQUES. THIS SYSTEM USES THE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) AND THE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR DEEP LEARNING OF MEDICINAL PLANT IMAGES. THIS RESEARCH WORK HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT ON THE LEAF DATASET OF FLAVIA FROM SOURCEFORGE WEBSITE. THIS DATA IS FED AS THE TRAINING DATASET FOR THE CNN AND MACHINE LEARNING BASED PROPOSED SYSTEM. AN ACCURACY OF 98% HAS BEEN ACHIEVED IN THE RECOGNITION OF THE MEDICINAL PLANT SPECIES. ALL THE PERFORMANCE METRICS LIKE PRECISION, RECALL, F1-SCORE AND SUPPORT ARE CALCULATED.

THESE RESOURCES ARE USUALLY REGARDED AS A PART OF CULTUREâ€™S TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE. ONE OF THE PREREQUISITES FOR ANY MEDICAL RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS AND/OR APPLICATIONS IS ACCURATE IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION OF MEDICINAL PLANTS. HENCE, LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY IN AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION OF THESE CURATIVE HERBS HAS BECOME ESSENTIAL. UNFORTUNATELY, BUILDING AND TRAINING A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL FROM SCRATCH IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE DUE TO THE LACK OF HARDWARE INFRASTRUCTURE AND FINANCE SUPPORT. IT PAINFULLY RESTRICTS THE REQUIREMENTS OF RAPID SOLUTIONS TO DEAL WITH THE DEMAND. FOR THIS PURPOSE, THIS PAPER EXPLOITS THE IDEA OF TRANSFER LEARNING WHICH IS THE IMPROVEMENT OF LEARNING IN A NEW PREDICTION TASK THROUGH THE TRANSFERABILITY OF KNOWLEDGE FROM A RELATED PREDICTION TASK THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN LEARNED.

SCISES ARE ALL-SOLID-STATE ION-SELECTIVE ELECTRODES WITH A CONDUCTING POLYMER FOR ION-TO-ELECTRON TRANSDUCTION. WITH THE CONDUCTING POLYMER SOLID-CONTACT, THE ELECTRODES PERFORM HIGH STABILITY AND SHORT RESPONSE TIME (<30 S) DURING POTENTIOMETRIC SENSING. THE DEVELOPED SCISE ARRAY CONSISTS OF POTASSIUM (SEN = 51.9 MV/DECADE), SODIUM (64.2 MV/DECADE), AMMONIUM (59.3 MV/DECADE), CALCIUM (32.1 MV/DECADE), AND MAGNESIUM (33.0 MV/DECADE) SELECTIVE ELECTRODES. TO VERIFY THE APPLICATION, SEVEN TYPES OF FRESH CRUDE VEGETABLE LEAF JUICES (ION CONCENTRATION RANGE: 10âˆ’3â€“10âˆ’4 M) WERE MEASURED WITH THE ARRAY, AND THE RESULT WAS COMPARED WITH ION CHROMATOGRAPHY. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE ARRAY WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN THE UNIQUE, DISTINGUISHABLE ION COMPOSITION PROFILE AS A RADAR PLOT OF EACH VEGETABLE SAP, IMPLYING THE FINGERPRINT APPLICATION OF THE PRESENT TECHNOLOGY. FURTHERMORE, APPLYING PRINCIPLE COMPONENT ANALYSIS (PCA) AND K-MEANS CLUSTERING, LETTUCES GROWN IN DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS (DEFICIENCY EITHER IN POTASSIUM OR IN NITRATE) ARE ABLE TO BE DISCRIMINATED.

"FATHI K M;MOHAMMED S N;KUHNERT K";FULLYAUTOMATIC NATURAL PLANT RECOGNITION SYSTEM USING DEEP NEURAL NETWORK FOR DYNAMIC OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENTS;THE LEAF, AS THE VITAL PART OF PLANTS, CAN BE AFFECTED BY PHYSICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL FACTORS WHICH MIGHT LEAD TO CHANGES IN ITS SHAPE, COLOR AND SIZE. THESE UNIQUE PARTS PLAY AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF PLANT RECOGNITION SYSTEMS, AS THE SHAPES OF LEAVES VARY AMONG DIFFERENT PLANTS. WEATHER TYPE AND RELATED FACTORS, SUCH AS LIGHT INTENSITY, HUMIDITY, TEMPERATURE AND WIND-SPEED, MAY HAVE EFFECTS ON THE NUMBER OF LEAVES THAT GROW ON A PLANT, THE AMOUNT OF FRESH AND DRIED LEAVES, THE DEFORMATION OF LEAVES, COLOR OF LEAVES, POSITIONS OF LEAVES ON BRANCHES, ETC. IN ADDITION, PHOTOGRAPHING IN OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENTS WITH DIFFERENT WEATHER CONDITIONS HAS UNDESIRED IMPACTS ON IMAGES. FOR INSTANCE, LIGHT SCATTERING CHANGES SEVERELY WHEN THERE ARE WATER DROPLETS DURING PHOTOGRAPHING WHICH INFLUENCES THE IMAGES CAPTURED IN RAINY WEATHER. DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PROPOSED FACTORS AND THE RELEVANT EFFECTS ON THE PLANTS, LEAVES AND IMAGES TAKEN FROM PLANTS, A PLANT RECOGNITION SYSTEM SHOULD BE INDEPENDENT FROM ALL ENVIRONMENTAL AND NON-ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS TO BE PRACTICALLY USEFUL AND APPLICABLE FOR IDENTIFYING PLANT SPECIES IN UNCONTROLLED OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENTS. MOREOVER, CHANGES IN THE TIME OF DAY (MORNING, NOON AND EVENING), THE DISTANCE BETWEEN CAMERA AND PLANT SPECIES AS WELL AS THE ANGLE AND ILLUMINATION OF THE OBJECT AND ENVIRONMENT WHEN THE IMAGES ARE TAKEN SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE PROCESS OF PLANT RECOGNITION. FOR INSTANCE, IN A WINDY WEATHER CONDITION, FOR AN OBSERVER EVEN FROM A SHORT DISTANCE, IT IS CHALLENGING TO DISTINGUISH ALL SINGLE LEAVES AND IDENTIFY THE PLANT TYPE FROM THE SHAPE OF ITS LEAF. FURTHERMORE, THE UNSTRUCTURED BACKGROUND OF THE IMAGES IS ANOTHER CHALLENGE WHICH AFFECTS THE IMAGES CAPTURED IN FIELDS AND OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENTS. THESE ARE ONLY SOME DIFFICULTIES FOR IDENTIFICATION OF PLANTS IN NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS SUCH AS FARMS, FORESTS, ETC. A CONSIDERATION OF MENTIONED FACTORS CONTRIBUTES TO DEVELOPING A NOVEL, EFFICIENT AND ACCURATE SYSTEM FOR PLANT RECOGNITION THAT CAN BE USED IN VARIOUS UNCONTROLLED OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENTS. IN THE REAL-LIFE, THE IMAGES OF THE PLANTS CAPTURED WITH THE PRESENCE OF THESE FACTORS ARE VERY CHALLENGING FOR RECOGNIZING PLANT SPECIES AND IT IS A DESIRE TO DEVELOP AN EFFICIENT AND ACCURATE SYSTEM THAT CAN BE USED IN VARIOUS NATURAL CONDITIONS AND UNCONTROLLED SITUATIONS. THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK FOR AUTOMATIC PLANT RECOGNITION IN UNCONTROLLED OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENTS. THE DEEP NETWORK HAS BEEN USED TO RECOGNIZE FOUR DIFFERENT NATURAL PLANT SPECIES. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM BRINGS THE OPPORTUNITY AND TRANSFORMATIVE POTENTIAL OF DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS TO THE PLANT RECOGNITION FIELD. THIS FULLY-AUTOMATIC SYSTEM IS EFFICIENT AND GENERALIZED FOR RECOGNITION OF PLANTS IN OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENTS LIKE FORESTS AND FARMS, AND ITS THE ACCURACY IS 99.5%. MEANWHILE, THE FINAL SYSTEM HAS THE FUNCTIONALITY OF BEING APPLIED AS A REAL-TIME ONE.

"GHOSH S;SINGH A";THE ANALYSIS OF PLANTS IMAGE CLASSIFICATION BASED ON MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES;WITH THE FAST DEVELOPMENT IN URBANIZATION AND POPULACE, IT HAS BECOME A SINCERE ERRAND TO SUPPORT AND DEVELOP PLANTS THAT ARE BOTH SIGNIFICANT IN SUPPORTING THE NATURE AND THE LIVING CREATUREâ€™S NEEDS. MOREOVER, THERE IS A REQUIREMENT FOR SAVING THE PLANTS HAVING WORLDWIDE SIGNIFICANCE BOTH FINANCIALLY AND NATURALLY. FINDING SUCH SPECIES FROM THE BACKWOODS OR BUSHES HAVING HUMAN CONTRIBUTION IS A TEDIOUS AND EXPENSIVE UNDERTAKING TO PERFORM. CLASSIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF PLANTS-LEAF ARE USEFUL FOR INDIVIDUALS TO VIABLY COMPREHEND AND ENSURE PLANTS. THE LEAVES OF PLANTS ARE THE MAIN ACKNOWLEDGMENT ORGANS. WITH THE ADVANCEMENT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND COMPUTER VISION INNOVATION, PLANT-LEAF RECOGNITION DEPENDENT ON PLANT-LEAF IMAGE INVESTIGATION IS UTILIZED TO IMPROVE THE INFORMATION ON PLANT CLASSIFICATION AND INSURANCE. DEEP LEARNING IS THE CONDENSING OF DEEP NEURAL NETWORK LEARNING TECHNIQUE AND HAS A PLACE WITH NEURAL ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE. IT CAN NATURALLY TAKE IN HIGHLIGHTS FROM HUGE INFORMATION AND UTILIZE ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK DEPENDENT ON BACK PROPAGATION METHODS TO PREPARE AND ORDER PLANT-LEAF TESTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES FOR IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION OF PLANT-LEAF IMAGE. SOME OF THE FAMOUS AND EFFECTIVE APPROACHES ARE RANDOM FOREST, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES, RESNET50, CNN, VGG16, VGG19, PNN, KNN, ETC. IN THIS PAPER, WE ARE GOING TO APPLY 9 MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES ON FLAVIA PLANT-LEAF IMAGE DATASET. FLAVIA PLANT-LEAF IMAGE DATASET CONSISTS OF 32 DIFFERENT SPECIES OF PLANT. THE IMAGES ARE FIRST PREPROCESSED AND THEN THEIR SHAPE, COLOR AND TEXTURE-BASED FEATURES ARE EXTRACTED FROM THE PROCESSED IMAGE. INITIAL THESE IMAGES ARE IN THE SIZE OF 256*256 PIXELS. THESE IMAGES WERE PREPROCESSED AND TAKEN UP TO THE SIZE OF 64*64 FOR FAST PROCESSING. RESNET50 HAS GIVEN THE BEST RESULTS WITH AN ACCURACY OF 98%.

IN THIS PAPER, WE FOCUS ON AN AGRICULTURAL ROBOTICS SYSTEM THAT ADDRESSES THE WEEDING PROBLEM BY MEANS OF SELECTIVE SPRAYING OR MECHANICAL REMOVAL OF THE DETECTED WEEDS. IN PARTICULAR, WE DESCRIBE A DEEP LEARNING BASED METHOD TO ALLOW A ROBOT TO PERFORM AN ACCURATE WEED/CROP CLASSIFICATION USING A SEQUENCE OF TWO CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS) APPLIED TO RGB IMAGES. THE FIRST NETWORK, BASED ON AN ENCODER-DECODER SEGMENTATION ARCHITECTURE, PERFORMS A PIXEL-WISE, PLANT-TYPE AGNOSTIC, SEGMENTATION BETWEEN VEGETATION AND SOIL THAT ENABLES TO EXTRACT A SET OF CONNECTED BLOBS REPRESENTING PLANT INSTANCES. WE SHOW THAT SUCH NETWORK CAN BE TRAINED ALSO USING EXTERNAL, READY TO USE PIXEL-WISE LABELED DATA SETS COMING FROM DIFFERENT CONTEXTS.

"KUMAR T P;ULAGAMUTHALVI V";A BRIEF REVIEW ON METHODS FOR CLASSIFICATION OF MEDICAL PLANT IMAGES;PLANTS ON EARTH PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE BOTH IN HUMAN AND OTHER LIVES. PLANTS HAVE THE GREATEST INFLUENCE IN THE NATURE CYCLE. PLANT IDENTIFICATION IN BIOLOGY AND FARMING IS VERY DEMANDING, AS NEW PLANT DISCOVERIES AND PLANT COMPUTERIZATION ARE MORE WELL ESTABLISHED. FOR A BROAD RANGE OF USES, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION, PLANT RESOURCE ASSESSMENT AND EDUCATION, AUTOMATIC PLANT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENTED. THE LEAVES ARE CONSIDERED THE WAY MEDICINAL PLANTS ARE CHARACTERIZED. THE AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION OF PLANT SPECIES USING PHOTOGRAPHIC LEAVES IS AN INTERESTING OBJECTIVE, AS BIODIVERSITY DECREASES RAPIDLY IN THE CURRENT MIX AND TAXONOMISTS LACK PROPERLY TRAINED. THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE RIGHT PLANT IS THE MOST CRITICAL STEP IN THE PREPARATION OF THE MEDICINE THAT IS CARRIED OUT MANUALLY. THE IDENTIFICATION OF THESE PLANTS IS IMMEDIATELY RELEVANT BECAUSE OF DEMAND FOR MASS PRODUCTION. THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OF HUMAN BEINGS IS CRUCIAL FOR MEDICINES. FOR BETTER CARE IT IS IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY AND CLASSIFY MEDICINAL PLANTS. THE LACK OF EXPERTS IN THIS AREA MAKES IT TEDIOUS THAT MEDICINAL PLANTS ARE PROPERLY IDENTIFIED AND CLASSIFIED. A FULLY AUTOMATED SYSTEM IS THEREFORE HIGHLY DESIRABLE FOR MEDICINAL PLANT CLASSIFICATION. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A BRIEF SURVEY OF THE VARIOUS MODELS FOR IDENTIFYING MEDICINAL PLANTS BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FORM AND TEXTURE OF A PLANT LEAF.

INITIATED IN THE CONTEXT OF A CITIZEN SCIENCES PROJECT, THE MAIN CONTRIBUTION OF THIS PAPER IS AN INNOVATIVE COLLABORATIVE WORKFLOW FOCUSED ON IMAGE-BASED PLANT IDENTIFICATION AS A MEAN TO ENLIST NEW CONTRIBUTORS AND FACILITATE ACCESS TO BOTANICAL DATA. SINCE 2010, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF GEO-TAGGED AND DATED PLANT PHOTOGRAPHS WERE COLLECTED AND REVISED BY HUNDREDS OF NOVICE, AMATEUR AND EXPERT BOTANISTS OF A SPECIALIZED SOCIAL NETWORK. AN IMAGE-BASED IDENTIFICATION TOOL - AVAILABLE AS BOTH A WEB AND A MOBILE APPLICATION - IS SYNCHRONIZED WITH THAT GROWING DATA AND ALLOWS ANY USER TO QUERY OR ENRICH THE SYSTEM WITH NEW OBSERVATIONS. AN IMPORTANT ORIGINALITY IS THAT IT WORKS WITH UP TO FIVE DIFFERENT ORGANS CONTRARILY TO PREVIOUS APPROACHES THAT MAINLY RELIED ON THE LEAF. THIS ALLOWS QUERYING THE SYSTEM AT ANY PERIOD OF THE YEAR AND WITH COMPLEMENTARY IMAGES COMPOSING A PLANT OBSERVATION. EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTS OF THE VISUAL SEARCH ENGINE AS WELL AS SYSTEM-ORIENTED AND USER-ORIENTED EVALUATIONS OF THE APPLICATION SHOW THAT IT IS ALREADY VERY HELPFUL TO DETERMINE A PLANT AMONG HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF SPECIES. AT THE TIME OF WRITING, THE WHOLE FRAMEWORK COVERS ABOUT HALF OF THE PLANT SPECIES LIVING IN FRANCE (2200 SPECIES), WHICH ALREADY MAKES IT THE WIDEST EXISTING AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION TOOL (WITH ITS IMPERFECTIONS).

"ZHOU C;GE L;GUO Y;ZHOU D;CUN Y";A COMPREHENSIVE COMPARISON ON CURRENT DEEP LEARNING APPROACHES FOR PLANT IMAGE CLASSIFICATION;PLANT IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION PLAY A KEY ROLE IN UNDERSTANDING, PROTECTING AND CONSERVING BIODIVERSITY. TRADITIONAL PLANT TAXONOMY NEEDS LONG TIME INTENSIVE TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE, WHICH LIMITED OTHERS TO IDENTIFY PLANT CATEGORIES. WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF AUTOMATED IMAGE-BASED CLASSIFICATION, MACHINE LEARNING (ML) IS BECOMING A POPULAR TOOL. IMAGE CLASSIFICATION, ESPECIALLY PLANT IMAGES TAXONOMY, HAS ACHIEVED GREAT IMPROVEMENT IN THESE YEARS BY DEEP LEARNING (DL) METHODS. IN THIS STUDY, WE FIRST REVIEWED CURRENT DEEP LEARNING APPLICATIONS IN THE FIELD OF PLANT IMAGE CLASSIFICATION, AND THEN WE TESTED SIX DEEP LEARNING METHODS IN FOUR PUBLIC PLANT IMAGE DATASETS. IN ORDER TO TEST THE CLASSIFICATION POWER OF DL METHODS AT CULTIVAR LEVEL, WE PREPARED A CAMELLIA SASANQUA THUNB. DATASET, WHICH IS CALLED CAMELLIA@CLAB, FOR ASSESSING CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE OF THE SIX DL METHODS. THESE DL MODELS' CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE ALL EXCEEDED 70% IN THE FOUR PUBLIC PLANT IMAGE DATASETS, AND LENET AND DENSENET HAD STABLE GOOD PERFORMANCE, WITH MEDIAN PREDICTION ACCURACY OF THE LENET WAS OVER 87.29% AND THAT OF DENSENET WAS OVER 93.8% IN THE FOUR PUBLIC DATASETS AT SPECIES LEVEL. AT CULTIVAR LEVEL, THE LOWEST MEDIAN PREDICTION ACCURACY OF THOSE DL METHODS DECREASED TO 62%, BUT LENET AND DENSENET STILL PERFORMED VERY WELL. THE PREDICTION ACCURACY OF LENET AND DENSENET WAS 82.3% AND 100% IN THE CAMELLIA@CLAB DATASET, RESPECTIVELY. DENSENET MODEL SHOWED A STABLE BEST CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE AMONG THE FIVE DATASETS. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY THAT PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW AND COMPARISON ON APPLYING CURRENT DL METHODS TO PLANT IMAGE CLASSIFICATION.

"FU H;CHI Z";COMBINED THRESHOLDING AND NEURAL NETWORK APPROACH FOR VEIN PATTERN EXTRACTION FROM LEAF IMAGES;LIVING PLANT RECOGNITION BASED ON IMAGES OF LEAF, FLOWER AND FRUIT IS A VERY CHALLENGING TASK IN THE FIELD OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND COMPUTER VISION. THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE WORK REPORTED ON FLOWER AND FRUIT IMAGE PROCESSING AND RECOGNITION. IN RECENT YEARS, SEVERAL RESEARCHERS HAVE DEDICATED THEIR WORK TO LEAF CHARACTERISATION. AS AN INHERENT TRAIT, LEAF VEIN DEFINITELY CONTAINS THE IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PLANT SPECIES RECOGNITION DESPITE ITS COMPLEX MODALITY. A NEW APPROACH THAT COMBINES A THRESHOLDING METHOD AND AN ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK (ANN) CLASSIFIER IS PROPOSED TO EXTRACT LEAF VEINS. A PRELIMINARY SEGMENTATION BASED ON THE INTENSITY HISTOGRAM OF LEAF IMAGES IS FIRST CARRIED OUT TO COARSELY DETERMINE VEIN REGIONS. THIS IS FOLLOWED BY A FINE SEGMENTATION USING A TRAINED ANN CLASSIFIER WITH TEN FEATURES EXTRACTED FROM A WINDOW CENTRED ON THE OBJECT PIXEL AS ITS INPUTS. COMPARED WITH OTHER METHODS, EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THIS COMBINED APPROACH IS CAPABLE OF EXTRACTING MORE ACCURATE VENATION MODALITY OF THE LEAF FOR THE SUBSEQUENT VEIN PATTERN CLASSIFICATION. THE APPROACH CAN ALSO REDUCE THE COMPUTING TIME COMPARED WITH A DIRECT NEURAL NETWORK APPROACH.

"FU H;CHI Z;FENG D;SONG J";MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES FOR ONTOLOGYBASED LEAF CLASSIFICATION;LEAF CLASSIFICATION, INDEXING AS WELL AS RETRIEVAL IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF A COMPUTERIZED PLANT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM. IN THIS PAPER, AN INTEGRATED APPROACH FOR AN ONTOLOGY-BASED LEAF CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM IS PROPOSED, WHEREIN MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE FOR THE AUTOMATIZATION OF THE SYSTEM. FOR THE LEAF CONTOUR CLASSIFICATION, A SCALED CCD CODE SYSTEM IS PROPOSED TO CATEGORIZE THE BASIC SHAPE AND MARGIN TYPE OF A LEAF BY USING THE SIMILAR TAXONOMY PRINCIPLE ADOPTED BY THE BOTANISTS. THEN A TRAINED NEURAL NETWORK IS EMPLOYED TO RECOGNIZE THE DETAILED TOOTH PATTERNS. THE MEASUREMENT ON AN UNLOBED LEAF IS ALSO CONDUCTED AUTOMATICALLY ACCORDING TO THE METHOD USED IN BOTANY. FOR THE LEAF VEIN RECOGNITION, THE VEIN TEXTURE IS EXTRACTED BY EMPLOYING AN EFFICIENT COMBINED THRESHOLDING AND NEURAL NETWORK APPROACH SO AS TO OBTAIN MORE VEIN DETAILS OF A LEAF. COMPARED WITH THE PAST STUDIES, THE PROPOSED METHOD INTEGRATES LOW-LEVEL FEATURES OF AN IMAGE AND THE SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE IN THE DOMAIN (ONTOLOGY) OF BOTANY, AND THEREFORE PROVIDES A MORE PRACTICAL SYSTEM FOR USERS TO COMPREHEND AND HANDLE.

THE APPROACH MADE USE OF TWO METHODS OF FEATURES EXTRACTION (ONE-DIMENSIONAL (1D) AND TWO-DIMENSIONAL (2D) TECHNIQUES) AND THE BAGGING CLASSIFIER. FOR THE 1D-BASED METHOD, PCA AND LDA TECHNIQUES WERE APPLIED, WHILE 2D-PCA AND 2D-LDA ALGORITHMS WERE USED FOR THE 2D-BASED METHOD. TO CLASSIFY THE EXTRACTED FEATURES IN BOTH METHODS, THE BAGGING CLASSIFIER, WITH THE DECISION TREE AS A WEAK LEARNER, WAS USED. THE PROPOSED APPROACH, WITH ITS FOUR FEATURE EXTRACTION TECHNIQUES, WAS TESTED USING FLAVIA DATASET WHICH CONSISTS OF 1907 COLORED LEAVES IMAGES. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE ACCURACY AND THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR APPROACH, WITH THE 2D-PCA AND 2D-LDA, WAS MUCH BETTER THAN USING THE PCA AND LDA. FURTHERMORE, IT WAS PROVEN THAT THE 2D-LDA-BASED METHOD GAVE THE BEST PLANT IDENTIFICATION ACCURACY AND INCREASING THE WEAK LEARNERS OF THE BAGGING CLASSIFIER LEADED TO A BETTER ACCURACY.

"KANG E;OH I";WEAK CONSTRAINT LEAF IMAGE RECOGNITION BASED ON CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK;RECENTLY THE COMPUTER VISION AND MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH COMMUNITIES PAY A GREAT ATTENTION TO THE LEAF IMAGE RECOGNITION PROBLEM. OUR LITERATURE SURVEY FOCUSING ON THE USER INTERACTION ASPECT REVEALS THAT TWO SCHEMES OF IMAGE ACQUISITION HAVE BEEN USED, ONE WITH STRONG CONSTRAINT AND THE OTHER WITH NO CONSTRAINT. THE STRONG CONSTRAINT INTERACTION ASKS USERS TO CAPTURE IMAGES BY PLACING A LEAF ON A UNIFORM BACKGROUND SUCH AS WHITE PAPER WHILE THE UNCONSTRAINED INTERACTION ALLOWS ANY FORM OF IMAGE CAPTURING. THE FORMER ONE GETS A HIGH PERFORMANCE SACRIFICING THE USER CONVENIENCE WHILE THE LATTER ONE PROVIDES A GREAT CONVENIENCE SACRIFICING THE RECOGNITION PERFORMANCE. OUR SCHEME IS WEAKLY CONSTRAINED IN THE MIDDLE OF TWO EXTREMES. THE PROPOSED INTERACTION SCHEME ONLY ASKS USERS TO CENTER THE LEAF ON SMARTPHONE CAMERA SCREEN. THE LEAF MAY BE ON THE TREE OR OFF THE TREE. WHEN THE LEAF IS PICKED OFF THE TREE, IT IS RECOMMENDED TO PLACE IT AGAINST RATHER UNIFORM BACKGROUND SUCH AS SKY, SOIL, OR TREE BARK.

DIAGNOSING THE ABNORMALITIES IN THE PLANT DEVELOPMENT IN A TIMELY AND ACCURATE MANNER PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PREVENTING THE LOSS OF CROP PRODUCTION YIELDS. THE CURRENT STUDY HAS BUILT A METHOD FOR RECOGNIZING THE CAUSES OF ABNORMALITIES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALOE ARBORESCENS L.

IMPLEMENTING A SYSTEM WHICH AUTOMATICALLY CLASSIFIES TREE SPECIES IS THE OVERALL GOAL. IN THIS PAPER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NET FOR SOLVING THIS CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM IS EXECUTED AND EVALUATED. THE OBJECTIVE IS CREATING A SYSTEM WHICH WORKS WELL ON UNSEEN DATA AND DERIVING GUIDELINES AND CONSTRAINTS TO GUARANTEE GOOD ACCURACY RESULTS. IMAGES INCLUDING TREE SEGMENTATION AND THE CORRESPONDING LABELS ARE PROVIDED AS TRAINING DATA. THE TREE SPECIES CLASSIFICATION TAKES THE SEGMENTATION RESULTS OF A STEREO VISION BASED IMAGE SEGMENTATION ALGORITHM AS INPUT. THE BASIC IDEA CONSISTS OF CROPPING THE TREE IMAGES INTO QUADRATIC BOXES BEFORE FEEDING THEM INTO THE NEURAL NET. FIRST, EACH BOX IS CLASSIFIED SEPARATELY AND THEN THE RESULTS ARE EVALUATED TO GET A CLASSIFICATION FOR THE WHOLE TREE. METHODS FOR RESULT IMPROVEMENT INCLUDE ALTERING BOX SIZE, USING OVERLAPPING BOXES, ARTIFICIALLY ENLARGING THE TRAINING SET, PRETRAINING AND FINETUNING. CROPPING A TREE IMAGE INTO BOXES OF A SPECIFIC SIZE AND ACCUMULATING THE SINGLE RESULTS TO GET A CLASSIFICATION OF THE WHOLE TREE LEADS TO AN ACCURACY OF 96.7% PROVIDED THAT SPECIFIC CONSTRAINTS LIKE MINIMUM BOX NUMBER AND THE PROJECTED SIZE OF THE TREE ON IMAGE PLANE ARE CONSIDERED.

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

"GOÃ‹AU H;BONNET P;JOLY A";OVERVIEW OF PLANTCLEF 2021 CROSSDOMAIN PLANT IDENTIFICATION;"AUTOMATED PLANT IDENTIFICATION HAS IMPROVED CONSIDERABLY THANKS TO RECENT ADVANCES IN DEEP LEARNING AND THE AVAILABILITY OF TRAINING DATA WITH MORE AND MORE FIELD PHOTOS. HOWEVER, THIS PROFUSION OF DATA CONCERNS ONLY A FEW TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SPECIES, MAINLY LOCATED IN NORTH AMERICA AND WESTERN EUROPE, MUCH LESS IN THE RICHEST REGIONS IN TERMS OF BIODIVERSITY SUCH AS TROPICAL COUNTRIES. ON THE OTHER HAND, FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES, BOTANISTS HAVE SYSTEMATICALLY COLLECTED, CATALOGUED AND STORED PLANT SPECIMENS IN HERBARIA, ESPECIALLY IN TROPICAL REGIONS, AND RECENT EFFORTS BY THE BIODIVERSITY INFORMATICS COMMUNITY HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE TO PUT MILLIONS OF DIGITISED RECORDS ONLINE. THE LIFECLEF 2021 PLANT IDENTIFICATION CHALLENGE (OR \PLANTCLEF 2021\"") WAS DESIGNED TO ASSESS THE EXTENT TO WHICH AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION OF FLORA IN DATA-POOR REGIONS CAN BE IMPROVED BY USING HERBARIUM COLLECTIONS. IT IS BASED ON A DATASET OF ABOUT 1,000 SPECIES MAINLY FOCUSED ON THE GUIANA SHIELD OF SOUTH AMERICA, A REGION KNOWN TO HAVE ONE OF THE HIGHEST PLANT DIVERSITIES IN THE WORLD. THE CHALLENGE WAS EVALUATED AS A CROSS-DOMAIN CLASSIFICATION TASK WHERE THE TRAINING SET CONSISTED OF SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND HERBARIUM SHEETS AND A FEW THOUSAND PHOTOS TO ALLOW LEARNING A CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE TWO DOMAINS. IN ADDITION TO THE USUAL METADATA (LOCATION, DATE, AUTHOR, TAXONOMY), THE TRAINING DATA ALSO INCLUDES THE VALUES OF 5 MORPHOLOGICAL AND FUNCTIONAL TRAITS FOR EACH SPECIES. THE TEST SET CONSISTED EXCLUSIVELY OF PHOTOS TAKEN IN THE FIELD.

"GHAPAR H;KHAIRUDDIN U;YUSOF R;KHAIRUDDIN A;AHMAD A";NEW FEATURE EXTRACTION FOR WOOD SPECIES RECOGNITION SYSTEM VIA STATISTICAL PROPERTIES OF LINE DISTRIBUTION;A KEY TO WOOD IDENTIFICATION IS THE DISTINGUISHABLE FEATURES FOUND ON THE CROSS-SECTIONAL SURFACE OF EACH TREE SPECIES. THE SURFACE PATTERN ON THE WOOD CROSS-SECTION MAY LOOK VERY SIMILAR TO NON-EXPERTS. HOWEVER, TRAINED EXPERTS MAY IDENTIFY WOOD SPECIES BASED ON DISTINCT AND DISCRIMINANT FEATURES OF THE PATTERN. AN AUTOMATIC WOOD RECOGNITION SYSTEM BASED ON MACHINE VISION TO EMULATE THE EXPERTS, THE KENALKAYU HAS BEEN DEVELOPED WITH HIGH CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY. UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN MORE WOOD SPECIES WERE ADDED INTO THE SYSTEM'S DATABASE, THE ACCURACY OF THE SYSTEM REDUCED. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE SYSTEM TO HAVE A CUSTOMIZED FEATURE EXTRACTOR SOLELY FOR WOOD PATTERN SUCH AS THE STATISTICAL PROPERTIES OF PORES DISTRIBUTION (SPPD) WHICH HAS BEEN PROVEN TO INCREASE THE SYSTEM'S ACCURACY. AS THE WOOD SURFACE PATTERN IS NOT ONLY DEFINED BY PORES, BUT LINES AS WELL, THIS PAPER PRESENTED ADDITIONAL NEW FEATURE EXTRACTION METHOD BASED ON STATISTICAL PROPERTIES OF LINE DISTRIBUTION (SPLD) TO CAPTURE THE DISCRIMINANT LINE FEATURES OF EACH SPECIES. WHEN USED ALONE AS FEATURE EXTRACTOR, THE SPLD MANAGED TO GET 88% ACCURACY, AND THE NUMBER INCREASES TO 99.5% WHEN COMBINED WITH SPPD FEATURES AND 100% WHEN COMBINED WITH BOTH SPPD AND BASIC GREY LEVEL AURA MATRIX FEATURES. IT SHOWS THAT THE SPLD IS AN ESSENTIAL CUSTOMIZED FEATURE EXTRACTOR FOR WOOD IDENTIFICATION PURPOSES.

"KAZEROUNI M;SAEED N;KUHNERT K";EXPLORATION OF AUTONOMOUS MOBILE ROBOTS THROUGH CHALLENGING OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENTS FOR NATURAL PLANT RECOGNITION USING DEEP NEURAL NETWORK;MODERNIZATION OF LIVING ENVIRONMENTS AND HUMAN ACTIVITIES HAVE SEVERE EFFECTS ON MANY PARAMETERS AND FACTORS SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE AND GLOBAL WARMING, AN INCREASE OF INCIDENCE AND THE SEVERITY OF WILDFIRES, LAND SURFACES AND ICE SHEETS, ECOLOGICAL IMBALANCE, CHANGE OF FERTILITY OF THE SOIL, FLOW OF ENERGY, FOOD SECURITY, ETC. IN ADDITION, HUMAN MODERNIZATION HAS HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON BIODIVERSITY AND THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT OF MODERNIZATION IS AGRICULTURE THAT ASSOCIATES WITH THE OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENT AND RELEVANT ISSUES. AUTOMATION OF AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES CONTRIBUTES TO REDUCING THE DEPENDENCY ON HUMAN LABOR AND THE HARMFUL EFFECTS ON THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. THE CORRECT IDENTIFICATION OF PLANTS IN OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENTS HAS BEEN NEGLECTED AND MANY CRITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND NON-ENVIRONMENTAL LIMITS AND FACTORS, SUCH AS WEATHER CONDITIONS, TIME, VIEWPOINT, LIGHTING CONDITIONS (ILLUMINATIONS AND LIGHT INTENSITY), DISTANCE, ETC., HAVE NOT BEEN CONSIDERED IN EXISTING PLANT RECOGNITION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES. HENCE, THERE IS A DEMAND TO DEVELOP MOBILE AND REAL-TIME SYSTEMS FOR PLANT RECOGNITION IN NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS. THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THESE CHALLENGES AND INTRODUCES THE APPLICATION OF AUTONOMOUS MOBILE ROBOT AND SEMI-ROBOTS FOR RECOGNITION OF NATURAL PLANT SPECIES IN OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENTS. FURTHERMORE, THE PROPOSED SYSTEM PRESENTS THE USE OF EMPLOYING LOW-COST CAMERAS, SUCH AS IPHONE 6S, CANON EOS 600D AND SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 4, FOR PLANT RECOGNITION SYSTEM IN REAL-TIME. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN TESTED WITH A NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS IN DIFFERENT YEARS, 2017 AND 2018, AND AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF DAY, MORNING AND EVENING.

PLANTS CLASSIFICATION IS CHALLENGING DUE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW SPECIES WITH A SIMILAR PATTERN AND LOOK-A-LIKE. MANY EFFORTS ARE MADE TO AUTOMATE PLANT CLASSIFICATION USING PLANT LEAF, PLANT FLOWER, BARK, OR STEM. AFTER MUCH EFFORT, IT HAS BEEN PROVEN THAT LEAF IS THE MOST RELIABLE SOURCE FOR PLANT CLASSIFICATION. BUT IT IS CHALLENGING TO IDENTIFY A PLANT WITH THE HELP OF LEAF STRUCTURE BECAUSE PLANT LEAF SHOWS SIMILARITY IN MORPHOLOGICAL VARIATIONS, LIKE SIZES, TEXTURES, SHAPES, AND VENATION. THEREFORE, IT IS REQUIRED TO NORMALIZE ALL PLANT LEAVES INTO THE SAME SIZE TO GET BETTER PERFORMANCE. CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNN) PROVIDES A FAIR AMOUNT OF ACCURACY WHEN LEAVES ARE CLASSIFIED USING THIS APPROACH. BUT THE PERFORMANCE CAN BE IMPROVED BY CLASSIFYING USING THE TRADITIONAL APPROACH AFTER APPLYING CNN.

TRADITIONAL PLANT CLASSIFICATION REQUIRES YEARS OF INTENSIVE TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR OTHERS TO CLASSIFY PLANTS. PLANT LEAF CLASSIFICATION IS A CHALLENGING ISSUE AS SIMILAR FEATURES APPEAR IN DIFFERENT PLANT SPECIES. WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF AUTOMATED IMAGE-BASED CLASSIFICATION, MACHINE LEARNING (ML) IS BECOMING VERY POPULAR. DEEP LEARNING (DL) METHODS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED PLANT IMAGE IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION. IN THE LAST DECADE, CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNN) HAVE ENTIRELY DOMINATED THE FIELD OF COMPUTER VISION, SHOWING OUTSTANDING FEATURE EXTRACTION CAPABILITIES AND SIGNIFICANT IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE. THE CAPABILITY OF CNN LIES IN ITS NETWORK. THE PRIMARY STRATEGY TO CONTINUE THIS TREND IN THE LITERATURE RELIES ON FURTHER SCALING NETWORKS IN SIZE. HOWEVER DUE TO INCREASE IN NETWORK SIZE, COSTS INCREASE RAPIDLY, WHILE PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS MAY BE MARGINAL.

"GOGUL I;KUMAR V";FLOWER SPECIES RECOGNITION SYSTEM USING CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORKS AND TRANSFER LEARNING;AUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION AND RECOGNITION OF MEDICINAL PLANT SPECIES IN ENVIRONMENTS SUCH AS FORESTS, MOUNTAINS AND DENSE REGIONS IS NECESSARY TO KNOW ABOUT THEIR EXISTENCE. IN RECENT YEARS, PLANT SPECIES RECOGNITION IS CARRIED OUT BASED ON THE SHAPE, GEOMETRY AND TEXTURE OF VARIOUS PLANT PARTS SUCH AS LEAVES, STEM, FLOWERS ETC. FLOWER BASED PLANT SPECIES IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS ARE WIDELY USED. WHILE MODERN SEARCH ENGINES PROVIDE METHODS TO VISUALLY SEARCH FOR A QUERY IMAGE THAT CONTAINS A FLOWER, IT LACKS IN ROBUSTNESS BECAUSE OF THE INTRA-CLASS VARIATION AMONG MILLIONS OF FLOWER SPECIES AROUND THE WORLD. HENCE IN THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH WORK, A DEEP LEARNING APPROACH USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNN) IS USED TO RECOGNIZE FLOWER SPECIES WITH HIGH ACCURACY. IMAGES OF THE PLANT SPECIES ARE ACQUIRED USING THE BUILT-IN CAMERA MODULE OF A MOBILE PHONE. FEATURE EXTRACTION OF FLOWER IMAGES IS PERFORMED USING A TRANSFER LEARNING APPROACH (I.E. EXTRACTION OF COMPLEX FEATURES FROM A PRE-TRAINED NETWORK). A MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFIER SUCH AS LOGISTIC REGRESSION OR RANDOM FOREST IS USED ON TOP OF IT TO YIELD A HIGHER ACCURACY RATE. THIS APPROACH HELPS IN MINIMIZING THE HARDWARE REQUIREMENT NEEDED TO PERFORM THE COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE TASK OF TRAINING A CNN. IT IS OBSERVED THAT, CNN COMBINED WITH TRANSFER LEARNING APPROACH AS FEATURE EXTRACTOR OUTPERFORMS ALL THE HANDCRAFTED FEATURE EXTRACTION METHODS SUCH AS LOCAL BINARY PATTERN (LBP), COLOR CHANNEL STATISTICS, COLOR HISTOGRAMS, HARALICK TEXTURE, HU MOMENTS AND ZERNIKE MOMENTS.

RECENTLY, ADOPTION OF REMOTE-SENSING APPROACHES HAS GAINED POPULARITY FOR SPECIES-LEVEL MAPPING OF VEGETATION. SPECIFICALLY, THE USE OF HYPERSPECTRAL DATA HAS DEMONSTRATED RELIABLE MAPPING ACCURACY. HOWEVER, WHEN WORKING WITH HYPERSPECTRAL DATA, FEATURE SELECTION IS FUNDAMENTAL TO ACHIEVING RELIABLE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACIES. MOREOVER, CHALLENGES SUCH AS â€˜THE CURSE OF DIMENSIONALITYâ€™ THAT CAUSE UNSTABLE PARAMETER ESTIMATES AND HIGH GENERALIZATION ERRORS WHEN THE NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS (N) IS LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF DESCRIPTIVE VARIABLES (P), I.E. N < P OFTEN COMPROMISE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY. IN THIS STUDY, WE ASSESSED THE POTENTIAL OF A HYBRID FEATURE SELECTION APPROACH, BASED ON STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES â€“ RECURSIVE FEATURE ELIMINATION (SVM-RFE) FOR DETERMINING A SUBSET OF HYPERSPECTRAL BANDS RELEVANT FOR DISCRIMINATING P. HYSTEROPHORUS USING FIELD SPECTROSCOPY DATA. WE COMPARED THE PERFORMANCE OF SVM-RFE, RANDOM FOREST VARIABLE IMPORTANCE (RF VARIMP), AND ENTIRE SPECTRAL DAT ASET (P =1633) USING SVM CLASSIFIER WITH RADIAL BASIS FUNCTION (RBF) KERNEL. RESULTS OF SVM-RFE AND RF VARIMP GENERATED LOWER CLASSIFICATION ACCURACIES (I.E. 76.19% AND 66.67%, RESPECTIVELY) THAN THE ENTIRE SPECTRAL DATA SET, I.E. 78.57%. ON THE OTHER HAND, USING A SUBSET OF 10 SPECTRAL BANDS, OUR HYBRID APPROACH YIELDED A SUPERIOR OVERALL ACCURACY OF 80.19% IN DISCRIMINATING P. HYSTEROPHORUS FROM ITS CO-OCCURRING SPECIES. THE STUDY SHOWED THAT A SUBSET CONSISTING OF TWO RED-EDGE BANDS LOCATED AT 685 AND 707 NM, ONE NEAR INFRARED BAND AT 1115 NM, AND SEVEN SHORT WAVE INFRARED BANDS AT 1971, 1982, 1990, 1966, 2003, 2005, AND 2013 NM HAD THE GREATEST POTENTIAL FOR DISCRIMINATION OF P. HYSTEROPHORUS AND CO-OCCURRING PLANT GROUPS. OVERALL, THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THE HYBRID APPROACH IS EFFECTIVE FOR EARLY DETECTION AND IMPROVEMENT OF INVASIVE ALIEN PLANTS CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY, REDUCING DATA DIMENSIONALITY AND SELECTING A RELEVANT SPECTRAL SUBSET OF BANDS.

IN AGRICULTURE, IDENTIFYING DISEASES IN THE PLANT LEAF IS A LEADING CHALLENGE FOR THE FARMERS BECAUSE DISEASE IN PLANTS REDUCES CROP PRODUCTION AND ALSO AFFECTS THE INCOME OF FARMERS. TO ENSURE THE MINIMUM LOSSES, AN ADVANCED MONITORING SYSTEM IS NEEDED TO DETECT AND CLASSIFY THE DISEASE FOR THE PLANT LEAVES. TO RESOLVE THIS CHALLENGE, THIS ARTICLE PROPOSED A METHOD FOR PLANT LEAF DISEASE CLASSIFICATION BY ADOPTING A SLIGHT VARIANT OF THE DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORK.

"GU J;YU P;LU X;DING W";LEAF SPECIES RECOGNITION BASED ON VGG16 NETWORKS AND TRANSFER LEARNING;COMPARED WITH OTHER PARTS OF THE PLANT, LEAVES ARE EASY TO OBTAIN AND HAVE OBVIOUS FEATURES. THEREFORE, LEAF IDENTIFICATION IS ALSO CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE BEST METHODS FOR PLANT IDENTIFICATION. FOR THIS REASON, A TRANSFER LEARNING LEAF RECOGNITION METHOD BASED ON VGG16 DEEP LEARNING NETWORK IS PROPOSED. THIS METHOD FIRSTLY CARRIES OUT PREPROCESS OPERATIONS SUCH AS BACKGROUND WHITENING AND STANDARD NORMALIZATION PROCESSING, THEN CARRIES OUT DATA AUGMENTATION, THEN USES TRANSFER LEARNING TO TRAIN VGG16 NETWORK MODEL, AND FINALLY COMPLETES LEAF RECOGNITION. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS OF MIDDLE EUROPEAN WOODY (MEW) PLANTS DATA SET AND UCI FOLIO LEAF DATA SET SHOW THAT THE RECOGNITION ACCURACY UNDER A SINGLE BACKGROUND REACHES 93.4% AND 97.9%, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN TRADITIONAL CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK AND OTHER RECOGNITION METHODS, EFFECTIVELY IMPROVING THE RECOGNITION ACCURACY RATE OF PLANT LEAVES.

"GULAC F;BAYAZIT U";PLANT AND PHENOLOGY RECOGNITION FROM FIELD IMAGES USING TEXTURE AND COLOR FEATURES;DETERMINATION OF THE PHENOLOGICAL STAGES OF PLANTS IS IMPORTANT FOR THE GROWTH OF HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE PLANTS. THE KNOWLEDGE OF TRANSITION TIMES OF PHENOLOGICAL STAGES OF A PLANT CAN PROVIDE VALUABLE DATA FOR PLANNING, ORGANIZING AND TIMELY EXECUTION OF AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES (SPRAYING, IRRIGATION ETC.). TARBIL IS AN AGRICULTURAL MONITORING AND INFORMATION SYSTEM THAT IS FOUNDED AND SUPPORTED BY REPUBLIC OF TURKEY MINISTRY OF FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND LIVESTOCK. THIS SYSTEM HAS A NETWORK OF STATIONS LOCATED IN MANY PARTS OF TURKEY. STATIONS, THAT CONTAIN MANY SENSORS AND CAMERAS, PERIODICALLY COLLECT IMAGES AND METEOROLOGICAL DATA FROM THE AGRICULTURAL FIELDS. PREVIOUS WORKS FOCUS ON EITHER ONLY ABOUT PLANT IDENTIFICATION OR ONLY PHENOLOGICAL STAGE RECOGNITION USING ONLY ONE TEXTURE ANALYSIS METHOD. OUR APPROACHMENT TO THE PROBLEM IS NOVEL BECAUSE NOT ONLY THE RECOGNITION OF THE PLANT TYPE OR THE RECOGNITION OF ONLY THE PHENOLOGICAL STAGE, BUT ALSO JOINT IDENTIFICATION OF THE PLANT TYPE AND THE PHENOLOGICAL STAGES ARE PROVIDED WITH SEVERAL TEXTURE AND COLOR FEATURE ANALYSIS METHODS. IN THIS WORK, A STUDY IS CONDUCTED TO COMPARE THE USE OF SEVERAL IMAGE TEXTURE FEATURES ALONG WITH COLOR FEATURES EXTRACTED FROM TARBIL FIELD IMAGE DATA FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE PLANTS AND THEIR PHENOLOGICAL STAGES.

AS A CONSEQUENCE, IT MAY DISTINGUISH SPECIFIC FEATURES MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN CONVENTIONAL COLOUR CAMERAS. THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY USED IN AGRICULTURE FOR VARIOUS APPLICATIONS SUCH AS CROP LEAF AREA INDEX, PLANT CLASSIFICATION AND DISEASE MONITORING. HOWEVER, THE ABUNDANCE OF INFORMATION IN HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGERY MAY CAUSE HIGH DIMENSIONALITY PROBLEM, LEADING TO COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY AND STORAGE ISSUES. FURTHERMORE, DATA AVAILABILITY IS ANOTHER MAJOR ISSUE. IN AGRICULTURE APPLICATION, TYPICALLY, IT IS DIFFICULT TO COLLECT EQUAL NUMBER OF SAMPLES AS SOME CLASSES OR DISEASES ARE RARE WHILE OTHERS ARE ABUNDANT AND EASY TO COLLECT. THIS MAY GIVE RISE TO AN IMBALANCED DATA PROBLEM THAT CAN SEVERELY REDUCE MACHINE LEARNING PERFORMANCE AND INTRODUCE BIAS IN PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT.

THIS PROJECT WILL GATHER AERIAL IMAGES OF FORESTS USING A DRONE. AFTER AERIAL IMAGES HAVE BEEN OBTAINED, A BESPOKE DATASET BASED ON THE CAPTURED AERIAL IMAGES WILL BE DEVELOPED. TO ESTIMATE THE TREE SPECIES BASED ON AERIAL IMAGES FROM THIS DATASET, WE WILL USE MACHINE LEARNING TO MAKE PREDICTIONS USING THIS INFORMATION. THIS RESEARCH INITIATIVE INTENDS TO COLLECT PHOTOGRAPHS OF MALAYSIAN FORESTS AND THEIR FAUNA, AS MALAYSIAN SPECIES ARE DISTINCT FROM THOSE OF OTHER NATIONS DUE TO THE COUNTRY'S CLIMATE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO IDENTIFY AND SEGMENT TREE SPECIES FROM HIGH-RESOLUTION RGB IMAGES OF TROPICAL FORESTS USING THE MASK R-CNN METHOD, A ROBUST SYSTEM FOR DETECTING TREE SPECIES. THE DEVELOPED ALGORITHM WAS VALIDATED ON TWO DATASETS IN WHICH THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS INDICATE A MEAN AVERAGE PRECISION (MAP) OF 19.17%, 67.9% FOR PRECISION, AND 16.9% FOR RECALL FOR THE IMPROVED MODEL. SPECIFICALLY, MAP IMPROVED BY 6.03%, 46.80% PRECISION, AND 2.27 RECALL OVER THE ORIGINAL MASK R-CNN. USING DIFFERENT DATASETS, THE ENHANCED MODEL DEMONSTRATED HIGH DETECTION AND SEGMENTATION ACCURACY AS WELL AS MAKING IT SUITABLE FOR PROVIDING TECHNICAL SUPPORT IN INTELLIGENT FOREST MANAGEMENT. A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF THIS ENDEAVOR COULD RESULT IN THE FIRST PHASE OF A FOREST INVENTORY, WHICH WOULD HAVE REPERCUSSIONS FOR LOGGING AND FOREST MANAGEMENT IN THE REGION.

FIRST, THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE CENTROID AND ALL POINTS ON THE LEAF CONTOURS WERE CALCULATED. SECOND, AN FFT WAS PERFORMED USING THE CALCULATED DISTANCES. TEN FEATURES WERE EXTRACTED USING THE CALCULATED DISTANCES, FFT MAGNITUDE, AND ITS PHASE. TEN FEATURES WERE ALSO EXTRACTED BASED ON THE DIGITAL MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES USING FOUR BASIC GEOMETRIC FEATURES AND FIVE VEIN FEATURES. TO VERIFY THE VALIDITY OF THE APPROACH, IMAGES OF 1907 LEAVES WERE USED TO CLASSIFY 32 KINDS OF PLANTS. IN THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS, THE PROPOSED LEAF RECOGNITION SYSTEM SHOWED AN AVERAGE RECOGNITION RATE OF 95.44 %, AND WE CAN CONFIRM THAT THE RECOGNITION RATE OF THE PROPOSED ADVANCED LEAF RECOGNITION METHOD WAS BETTER THAN THAT OF THE EXISTED LEAF RECOGNITION METHOD.

"LEE K;LI X;HONG K";PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT OF LEAF CONTOUR EXTRACTION IN COMPLEX BACKGROUND FOR LEAF RECOGNITION;IN THIS SYSTEM WE IMPROVED THE PERFORMANCE OF AN AUTOMATIC SYSTEM FOR EXTRACTING LEAF CONTOUR. THE PROPOSED LEAF CONTOUR EXTRACTION METHOD CONSISTS OF THREE MAJOR PROCEDURES: THE DETECTION OF FOUR EDGE POINTS, AND CONTOUR TRACING. LEAF DETECTION INCLUDES TWO STAGES: FEATURE EXTRACTION AND MATCHING. FOR THE LEAF CONTOUR EXTRACTION PART, WE PRESENT A NEW TECHNIQUE FOR AUTOMATICALLY IDENTIFYING THE CONTOUR OF A LEAF IN AN IMAGE. FOR CONTOUR TRACING, AN INTELLIGENT SCISSOR (IS) ALGORITHM IS APPLIED. THE COLOR GRADIENT MAGNITUDE AND CANNY EDGE DETECTION ARE ANALYZED AND INCLUDED AS THE COST TERMS OF THE INTELLIGENT SCISSOR ALGORITHM.

COLLECTING A LARGE DATASET IS TIME-CONSUMING AND COSTLY, ESPECIALLY FOR PLANTS. WHEN A LARGE DATASET IS NOT AVAILABLE, THE CHALLENGE IS HOW TO USE A SMALL OR MEDIUM SIZE DATASET TO TRAIN A DEEP MODEL OPTIMALLY. TO OVERCOME THIS CHALLENGE, A NOVEL MODEL IS PROPOSED TO USE THE AVAILABLE SMALL SIZE PLANT DATASET EFFICIENTLY. THIS MODEL FOCUSES ON DATA AUGMENTATION AND AIMS TO IMPROVE THE LEARNING ACCURACY BY OVERSAMPLING THE DATASET THROUGH REPRESENTATIVE IMAGE PATCHES. TO EXTRACT THE RELEVANT PATCHES, ORB KEY POINTS ARE DETECTED IN THE TRAINING IMAGES AND THEN IMAGE PATCHES ARE EXTRACTED USING AN INNOVATIVE ALGORITHM. THE EXTRACTED ORB IMAGE PATCHES ARE USED FOR DATASET AUGMENTATION TO AVOID OVERFITTING DURING THE TRAINING PHASE. THE PROPOSED MODEL IS IMPLEMENTED USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL LAYERS, WHERE ITS STRUCTURE IS BASED ON RESNET ARCHITECTURE. THE PROPOSED MODEL IS EVALUATED ON A CHALLENGING ACHENY DATASET.

"HIDAYAT T;NILAWATI A";IDENTIFICATION OF PLANT TYPES BY LEAF TEXTURES BASED ON THE BACKPROPAGATION NEURAL NETWORK;THE NUMBER OF SPECIES OF PLANTS OR FLORA IN INDONESIA IS ABUNDANT. THE WEALTH OF INDONESIA'S FLORA SPECIES IS NOT TO BE DOUBTED. ALMOST EVERY REGION IN INDONESIA HAS ONE OR SOME DISTINCTIVE PLANT(S) WHICH MAY NOT EXIST IN OTHER COUNTRIES. IN ENHANCING THE POTENTIAL DIVERSITY OF TROPICAL PLANT RESOURCES, GOOD MANAGEMENT AND UTILIZATION OF BIODIVERSITY IS REQUIRED. BASED ON SUCH DIVERSITY, PLANT CLASSIFICATION BECOMES A CHALLENGE TO DO. THE MOST COMMON WAY TO RECOGNIZE BETWEEN ONE PLANT AND ANOTHER IS TO IDENTIFY THE LEAF OF EACH PLANT. LEAF-BASED CLASSIFICATION IS AN ALTERNATIVE AND THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO DO BECAUSE LEAVES WILL EXIST ALL THE TIME, WHILE FRUITS AND FLOWERS MAY ONLY EXIST AT ANY GIVEN TIME. IN THIS STUDY, THE RESEARCHERS WILL IDENTIFY PLANTS BASED ON THE TEXTURES OF THE LEAVES. LEAF FEATURE EXTRACTION IS DONE BY CALCULATING THE AREA VALUE, PERIMETER, AND ADDITIONAL FEATURES OF LEAF IMAGES SUCH AS SHAPE ROUNDNESS AND SLENDERNESS. THE RESULTS OF THE EXTRACTION WILL THEN BE SELECTED FOR TRAINING BY USING THE BACKPROPAGATION NEURAL NETWORK. THE RESULT OF THE TRAINING (THE FORMATION OF THE TRAINING SET) WILL BE CALCULATED TO PRODUCE THE VALUE OF RECOGNITION ACCURACY WITH WHICH THE FEATURE VALUE OF THE DATASET OF THE LEAF IMAGES IS THEN TO BE MATCHED. THE RESULT OF THE IDENTIFICATION OF PLANT SPECIES BASED ON LEAF TEXTURE CHARACTERISTICS IS EXPECTED TO ACCELERATE THE PROCESS OF PLANT CLASSIFICATION BASED ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LEAVES.

THE HYPERSPECTRAL REFLECTANCES OF 13 TYPES OF PLANTS WERE MEASURED BY AN ASD FIELDSPEC 4 SPECTRORADIOMETER. TWO FORMS OF SPECTRAL FEATURES WERE USED FOR REPRESENTING THE KEY SPECTRAL CHARACTERISTICS OF PLANTS, INCLUDING VEGETATION INDEX (VI) AND SPECTRAL SHAPE FEATURES. BASED ON THESE SPECTRAL FEATURES, A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES FOR ESTABLISHING THE CLASSIFIER. THE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA) AND THE CROSS-CORRELATION ANALYSIS WERE APPLIED TO DERIVE THE SENSITIVITY OF FEATURES AND REMOVE FEATURES THAT HAVE HIGH CORRELATIONS. THEN, A CLASSIFICATION METHOD FOR DIFFERENTIATING PLANTS WAS ESTABLISHED BY COUPLING SOME SPECTRAL SIMILARITY MEASURES (E.G., ED) WITH SOME CLASSIFICATION METHODS (E.G., BPANN AND SVM). THE RESULTS OF DISCRIMINATION ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT A HIGHEST ACCURACY WAS PRODUCED BY SVM WITH THE OAA OVER 99% WHEN USING 7 SENSITIVE VIS.

SUCH IS THE CASE OF COLOMBIA, A BANANA EXPORT COUNTRY IN WHICH MUCH OF ITS PRODUCTION IS STILL CARRIED OUT BY SMALL PEASANT FAMILIES WITHOUT A HIGH DEGREE OF MODERNIZATION. THE PLANT IS QUITE SENSITIVE TO DISEASES CAUSED BY ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, BACTERIA, AND VIRUSES. INFECTIONS CAN SPREAD RAPIDLY AND CAUSE GREAT DAMAGE TO THE PLANTATIONS. FOR THIS REASON, IT IS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP HIGH PERFORMANCE AND VERY LOW-COST TECHNOLOGIES CAPABLE OF QUICKLY IDENTIFYING THE DAMAGE, TO CONTROL IT AND REDUCE LOSSES. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE PROPOSE A CONVOLUTIONAL MODEL BASED ON A DEEP NEURAL NETWORK FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF BANANA PLANT LEAF DAMAGE FROM IMAGES. THE MODEL IS TRAINED SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS PROBLEM WITH REAL IMAGES CAPTURED IN DIFFERENT STATES OF AFFECTATION OF LEAVES OF THE PLANT. THE MODEL IS SUITABLE TO BE PROPAGATED ON A VERY LOW-COST EMBEDDED SYSTEM, AND THEREFORE SUITABLE TO BE USED IN SMALL PLANTATIONS.

CAPTURING THE LEAF AS AN IMAGE ALLOWS CONSTRUCTING AN AUTOMATIC SYSTEM OF HERBS RECOGNITION USING IMAGE PROCESSING. TWO STEPS OF IMAGE PROCESSING FOR RECOGNITION ARE FEATURE EXTRACTION AND CLASSIFICATION. 2D GABOR FILTER AND HU'S MOMENT INVARIANTS ARE USED TO FEATURE EXTRACTION PROCESS. 2D GABOR FILTERS ARE INFLUENCED BY SOME VECTORS THAT HAVE DIFFERENT VALUES FOR EACH FEATURE OF LEAVES. THE HU'S MOMENT INVARIANTS ARE INFLUENCED BY THE GEOMETRIC OPERATION. THE NEXT STEP IS CLASSIFICATION GROUPING THE RESULT OF THE FEATURE EXTRACTION INTO THE RIGHT CLUSTER. IN THIS RESEARCH, TWO CLASSIFICATION METHODS WILL BE COMBINED WITH THE TWO FEATURE EXTRACTION METHODS. THE FIRST IS HU'S MOMENT INVARIANTS AND BACKPROPAGATION NEURAL NETWORK AND THE SECOND IS 2D GABOR FILTER AND LEARNING VECTOR QUANTIZATION. EACH OF COMBINATION GIVES THE DIFFERENT RESULTS.

THERE ARE VARIOUS TYPES OF HERBAL PLANTS THAT CAN BE USED AS MEDICINE BUT DUE TO THE LIMITED ABILITY OF COMMUNITIES TO RECOGNIZE THE TYPE OF PLANTS AND THE LACK OF INFORMATION, BOTH CAUSE THE LIMITED USE OF PLANTS AS MEDICINE. IN THIS RESEARCH, AN HERBAL PLANTS IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM BASED ON LEAVES PATTERN WAS DEVELOPED. THIS IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM IS BASED ON THE SHAPE OF THE HERBAL PLANTS' LEAVES. BEFORE IDENTIFICATION, PREPROCESSING STAGES SHOULD BE PERFORMED SUCH AS CONVERSION TO GRAYSCALE IMAGE, CONVERSION TO BINARY IMAGE, AND IMAGE SEGMENTATION USING OTSU'S METHOD. FEATURE EXTRACTION METHOD USED IN THIS SYSTEM IS ONE KIND OF REGION-BASED INVARIANT FEATURE EXTRACTION, WHICH IS WELL-KNOWN AS HU'S SEVEN MOMENTS INVARIANT AND THE EUCLIDEAN OR CANBERRA DISTANCE AS A RECOGNITION METHOD. THE RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED ON 15 TYPES OF HERBAL PLANTS. BASED ON THE RESEARCH, THE PERCENTAGE OF RECOGNITION IN THIS IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM USING EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE REACHED 86.67% WITH THE LOWEST RECOGNITION RATE IS 40% FOR MANGKOKAN LEAF. WHILE USING CANBERRA DISTANCE FOR RECOGNIZING, THE PERCENTAGE OF RECOGNITION IS 72% AND THE LOWEST RECOGNITION RATE IS 20% FOR KEJI BELING LEAF. THE BEST RECOGNITION RATE OF 100% FOR EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE SIMILARITY MEASURE IS REACHED WHEN 9 (NINE) TYPES OF LEAVES WERE IMPLEMENTED, I.E.

"JABIR B;RABHI L;FALIH N";RNN AND CNNBASED WEED DETECTION FOR CROP IMPROVEMENT AN OVERVIEW;INTRODUCTION. DEEP LEARNING IS A MODERN TECHNIQUE FOR IMAGE PROCESSING AND DATA ANALYSIS WITH PROMISING RESULTS AND GREAT POTENTIAL. SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED IN VARIOUS FIELDS, IT HAS RECENTLY ENTERED THE FIELD OF AGRICULTURE TO ADDRESS SUCH AGRICULTURAL PROBLEMS AS DISEASE IDENTIFICATION, FRUIT/PLANT CLASSIFICATION, FRUIT COUNTING, PEST IDENTIFICATION, AND WEED DETECTION. THE LATTER WAS THE SUBJECT OF OUR WORK. WEEDS ARE HARMFUL PLANTS THAT GROW IN CROPS, COMPETING FOR THINGS LIKE SUNLIGHT AND WATER AND CAUSING CROP YIELD LOSSES. TRADITIONAL DATA PROCESSING TECHNIQUES HAVE SEVERAL LIMITATIONS AND CONSUME A LOT OF TIME. THEREFORE, WE AIMED TO TAKE INVENTORY OF DEEP LEARNING NETWORKS USED IN AGRICULTURE AND CONDUCT EXPERIMENTS TO REVEAL THE MOST EFFICIENT ONES FOR WEED CONTROL. STUDY OBJECTS AND METHODS. WE USED NEW ADVANCED ALGORITHMS BASED ON DEEP LEARNING TO PROCESS DATA IN REAL TIME WITH HIGH PRECISION AND EFFICIENCY. THESE ALGORITHMS WERE TRAINED ON A DATASET CONTAINING REAL IMAGES OF WEEDS TAKEN FROM MOROCCAN FIELDS. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. THE ANALYSIS OF DEEP LEARNING METHODS AND ALGORITHMS TRAINED TO DETECT WEEDS SHOWED THAT THE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK IS THE MOST WIDELY USED IN AGRICULTURE AND THE MOST EFFICIENT IN WEED DETECTION COMPARED TO OTHERS, SUCH AS THE RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK. CONCLUSION. SINCE THE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK DEMONSTRATED EXCELLENT ACCURACY IN WEED DETECTION, WE ADOPTED IT IN BUILDING A SMART SYSTEM FOR DETECTING WEEDS AND SPRAYING THEM IN PLACE.

"MAHURKAR D;PATIDAR H";PARTICULAR LEAF CONTOUR BASED FEATURE EXTRACTION TECHNIQUE TO IDENTIFY THE SPECIES WHEN THE LEAF IS SHROUDED;A CRITICAL AND CHALLENGING IN PATTERN RECOGNITION IS THE IDENTIFICATION OF PLANT SPECIES FROM OBSTRUCTED LEAF PHOTOGRAPHS. THE BIGGEST ISSUE AT THAT TIME IS TO ACCURATELY IDENTIFY THE SPECIES OF LEAF WHEN ALL OF THE LEAVES ARE IDENTICAL IN APPEARANCE AND OBSCURED. SHAPE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT VISUAL ELEMENTS AND IS ALSO RECOGNIZED AS A FUNDAMENTAL ATTRIBUTE FOR CONVEYING THE CONTENT OF PICTURES. SINCE IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO GAUGE HOW SIMILAR DISTINCT FORMS ARE TO ONE ANOTHER, AS WELL AS DESCRIBE THE CONTENT OF SHAPES. THE TWO MAIN CATEGORIES OF SHAPE DESCRIPTORS ARE REGION-BASED AND CONTOUR-BASED SHAPE DESCRIPTORS (CBSD) TECHNIQUES. REGION-BASED APPROACHES USE THE COMPLETE AREA OF AN ITEM FOR SHAPE DESCRIPTION AS OPPOSED TO CONTOUR-BASED APPROACHES THAT ONLY USE THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN AN IMAGE'S CONTOUR. IN THIS STUDY, WE PRESENTED A SHAPE DESCRIPTION APPROACH CALLED PARTICULAR CONTOUR-BASED SHAPE DESCRIPTORS (PCBSD) FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE PLANT LEAVES SINCE THE CBSD RECOVERED THE LOW LEVEL VISUAL PROPERTIES OF THE PICTURES. THIS METHOD SUCCESSFULLY CAPTURES THE LOCAL AND GLOBAL CHARACTERISTICS OF A LEAF SHAPE WHILE PRESERVING THE TRANSLATION, ROTATION, AND SCALING SIMILARITY TRANSFORMATIONS. THIS METHOD IS ALSO QUITE COMPACT AND HAS A LOW PROCESSING COMPLEXITY. TO EVALUATE OUR EXPERIMENTS, WE UTILIZED FLAVIA DATASETS OF TYPICAL PLANT LEAVES. WE SHOW THAT OUR TECHNIQUE CREATED THE BEST COMPLETE LEAF MATCH WHEN HIGH OCCLUSION (AROUND 50% OCCLUSION) OCCURS. WE MAY SAY THAT OUR METHOD EXCEEDS PRIOR STATE-OF-THE-ART SHAPE-BASED PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION ALGORITHMS AND IT GENERATES ACCURACY OF 76%.PICTURE PROCESSING METHODS ARE USED TO SEPARATE THE LEAF-BASED CHARACTERISTICS FROM THE LEAF IMAGE.

"JOSE C;ERICK M;HERVE G";HIDDEN BIASES IN AUTOMATED IMAGEBASED PLANT IDENTIFICATION;PLANT IDENTIFICATION IS CRITICAL TO SUPPORT IMPORTANT BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION ACTIONS SUCH AS BIODIVERSITY INVENTORIES, MONITORING OF POPULATIONS OF ENDANGERED ORGANISMS, AND ASSESSING CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACT, AMONG MANY OTHERS. BECAUSE DEEP LEARNING HAS DEMONSTRATED IMPRESSIVE RESULTS IN THE FIELD OF COMPUTER VISION IN GENERAL, RESEARCH ON AUTOMATIC PLANT IDENTIFICATION HAS BEEN SHIFTING ITS ATTENTION TOWARDS DEEP LEARNING APPROACHES. HOWEVER, SOME AUTHORS HAVE NOTICED THAT AN IMPORTANT METHODOLOGICAL ISSUE MAY HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKED IN THE DESIGN OF MANY EXPERIMENTS, WHICH MAY EXPLAIN WHY, ON ONE HAND, SOME STUDIES BASED ON HAND-CRAFTED FEATURE EXTRACTION APPROACHES REPORT VERY HIGH ACCURACY LEVELS, BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND, NEWER DEEP LEARNING APPROACHES USED IN EVENTS SUCH AS THE PLANTCLEF CHALLENGE REPORT RELATIVELY LOWER ACCURACY LEVELS. BECAUSE PLANTCLEF USES SAME SPECIMEN PHOTOS EXCLUSIVELY IN EITHER THE TRAINING DATASET OR THE TESTING DATASET, WE POSTULATE THAT THIS MAY EXPLAIN THE LOWER ACCURACIES ACHIEVED. SPECIFICALLY, WE EXPLORE THE FOLLOWING TWO QUESTIONS: DOES USING DIFFERENT IMAGES OF THE SAME SPECIMEN FOR TRAINING AND TESTING INTRODUCE A SIGNIFICANT BIAS IN DEEP LEARNING EXPERIMENTS AS WELL AS IN THOSE THAT USE HANDCRAFTED FEATURES IN CLASSICAL COMPUTER VISION TECHNIQUES? DOES IT AFFECT THE ACCURACY OF SPECIES IDENTIFICATIONS EVEN IN THE MORE RESTRICTED DOMAIN OF LEAF-BASED AUTOMATED SPECIES IDENTIFICATIONS? WE ALSO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF SCALABILITY OF ACCURACY RESULTS FOR BOTH, A PARTICULAR FEATURE EXTRACTION APPROACH AND A DEEP LEARNING APPROACH. ALL EXPERIMENTS ARE CONDUCTED ON A DATASET OF 7,262 PHOTOS OF LEAVES OF 255 SPECIES OF PLANTS FROM COSTA RICA.

"MARTINS J;OLIVEIRA L;WEINGAERTNER D;BARISON A;OLIVEIRA G;LIÃƒO L";A DATABASE FOR AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION OF GENDER IN ARAUCARIA ANGUSTIFOLIA PLANTS;FORESTS HAVE BEEN DISORDERLY EXPLOITED, AND MANY SPECIES ARE CONSIDERED ENDANGERED. SOME INITIATIVES HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN ORDER TO PREVENT FORESTS FROM BEING DESTROYED. A GOOD ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE TO PLAN A SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF PLANTS, WITH HIGHER NUMBER OF FEMALES THAN MALES. DETERMINING THE GENDER OF SEEDLINGS WOULD PROVIDE IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR A POSSIBLE STRATEGY. ANOTHER COMMON PROBLEM THAT RESEARCHERS IN THIS FIELD VERY OFTEN FACE, IN ORDER TO PERFORM THEIR EXPERIMENTS, IS THE LACK OF A REPRESENTATIVE DATABASE. TO OVERCOME THIS DIFFICULTY, WE INTRODUCE A NEW DATABASE IN THIS WORK, WHICH IS COMPOSED OF NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE OF ADULT ARAUCARIA ANGUSTIFOLIA PLANTS. IN ORDER TO GAIN BETTER INSIGHT INTO THIS DATABASE, WE HAVE TESTED DIFFERENT STRATEGIES AND CLASSIFIERS. A FIRST SET OF EXPERIMENTS TOOK THREE CLASSIFIERS TRAINED TO DISCRIMINATE MALES FROM FEMALES CONSIDERING THE ORIGINAL DATABASE. A SECOND ROUND OF EXPERIMENTS APPLIED THE GENETIC ALGORITHM TECHNIQUE TO SELECT SUBSETS OF ATTRIBUTES BASED ON SINGLE-OBJECTIVE AND TWO-OBJECTIVE FUNCTIONS. AFTER ANALYZING THE ACHIEVED RESULTS, WE HAVE ALSO PROPOSED A NEW STRATEGY BASED ON STATISTICAL MEASURES FOR SELECTING SUBSETS FROM THE ATTRIBUTES. A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF EXPERIMENTS HAS SHOWN THAT THE PROPOSED SELECTING STRATEGY HAS ACHIEVED BETTER PERFORMANCES, WITH AN ACCURACY OF 80.3% (AUC = 79.4). WE BELIEVE THAT RESEARCHERS WILL FIND THIS DATABASE A USEFUL TOOL IN THEIR WORK ON DETERMINING THE ARAUCARIA ANGUSTIFOLIA GENDER. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE PROPOSED SELECTING STRATEGY WOULD BE USEFUL FOR REDUCING THE COMPLEXITY OF DATABASES AND ACCELERATING THE PROCESS OF BUILDING CLASSIFICATION MODELS.

"KALA J;VIRIRI S";PLANT SPECIE CLASSIFICATION USING SINUOSITY COEFFICIENTS OF LEAVES;FORESTS ARE THE LUNGS OF OUR PLANET. CONSERVING THE PLANTS MAY REQUIRE THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM THAT WILL IDENTIFY PLANTS USING LEAF FEATURES SUCH AS SHAPE, COLOR, AND TEXTURE. IN THIS PAPER, A LEAF SHAPE DESCRIPTOR BASED ON SINUOSITY COEFFICIENTS IS PROPOSED. THE SINUOSITY COEFFICIENTS ARE DEFINED USING THE SINUOSITY MEASURE, WHICH IS A MEASURE EXPRESSING THE DEGREE OF MEANDERING OF A CURVE. THE INITIAL EMPIRICAL EXPERIMENTS PERFORMED ON THE LEAFSNAP DATASET ON THE USAGE OF FOUR SINUOSITY COEFFICIENTS TO CHARACTERIZE THE LEAF IMAGES USING THE RADIAL BASIS FUNCTION NEURAL NETWORK (RBF) AND MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON (MLP) CLASSIFIERS ACHIEVED ACCURATE CLASSIFICATION RATES OF 88% AND 65%, RESPECTIVELY. THE PROPOSED FEATURE EXTRACTION TECHNIQUE IS FURTHER ENHANCED THROUGH THE ADDITION OF LEAF GEOMETRICAL FEATURES, AND THE ACCURATE CLASSIFICATION RATES OF 93% AND 82% WERE ACHIEVED USING RBF AND MLP, RESPECTIVELY. THE OVERALL RESULTS ACHIEVED SHOWED THAT THE PROPOSED FEATURE EXTRACTION TECHNIQUE BASED ON THE SINUOSITY COEFFICIENTS OF LEAVES, COMPLEMENTED WITH GEOMETRICAL FEATURES IMPROVE THE ACCURACY RATE OF PLANT CLASSIFICATION USING LEAF RECOGNITION.

AT PRESENT, MANY RESEARCHERS FOCUS ON THE RESEARCH OF FOREST TYPE CLASSIFICATION OR TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION USING DIFFERENT MACHINE LEARNING METHODS AND TRY TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF CLASSIFICATION OF SATELLITE IMAGE. HOWEVER, FOREST TYPE CLASSIFICATION USING DEEP BELIEF NETWORK (DBN) IS STILL LIMITED IN PREVIOUS LITERATURES. OUR RESEARCH FOCUSES ON FOREST MAPPING IN THE WESTERN PART OF DEHUA COUNTY IN SOUTHERN CHINA. MOST IMPORTANT OBJECTIVE WAS TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF FOREST MAPPING FROM HYPERSPECTRAL DATA USING DEEP LEARNING. THE HJ-1A HYPERSPECTRAL DATA WAS ADOPTED IN THIS PAPER. WE APPLIED DEEP BELIEF NETWORK AND GOT A THEMATIC MAP OF FOUR FOREST TYPES, SUCH AS CONIFEROUS FOREST, BROAD-LEAVED FOREST, MIXED FOREST AND NON-FOREST. OUR FINDING SHOWS THAT OPTIMAL NETWORK DEPTH OF DBN MODEL IS 3 AND BEST NODE IN EACH LAYER IS 256 IN OUR EXPERIMENT. OVERALL ACCURACY IS 85.8% AND KAPPA COEFFICIENT IS 0.785 WITH BEST-FIT PARAMETERS IN DBN MODEL, WHILE FOR SVM IS 73% AND 0.6447 RESPECTIVELY.

ALSO, THERE IS AN INCREASED INTEREST IN PLANTATION AND ITS EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT. WITH VAST AREAS SUITABLE FOR FARMING, COUNTRIES ARE ALWAYS ENCOURAGING FARMERS THROUGH VARIOUS PROGRAMS TO INCREASE NATIONAL FARMING PRODUCTION. HOWEVER, THE VAST AREAS AND LARGE FARMS MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR FARMERS AND WORKERS TO CONTINUALLY MONITOR THESE BROAD AREAS TO PROTECT THE PLANTS FROM DISEASES AND VARIOUS WEATHER CONDITIONS. A NEW CONCEPT DUBBED PRECISION FARMING HAS RECENTLY SURFACED IN WHICH THE LATEST TECHNOLOGIES PLAY AN INTEGRAL ROLE IN THE FARMING PROCESS. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A SMART DRONE SYSTEM EQUIPPED WITH HIGH PRECISION CAMERAS, HIGH COMPUTING POWER WITH PROPOSED IMAGE PROCESSING METHODOLOGIES, AND CONNECTIVITY FOR PRECISION FARMING. THE SMART SYSTEM WILL AUTOMATICALLY MONITOR VAST FARMING AREAS WITH PRECISION, IDENTIFY INFECTED PLANTS, DECIDE ON THE CHEMICAL AND EXACT AMOUNT TO SPRAY. BESIDES, THE SYSTEM IS CONNECTED TO THE CLOUD SERVER FOR SENDING THE IMAGES SO THAT THE CLOUD SYSTEM CAN GENERATE REPORTS, INCLUDING PREDICTION ON CROP YIELD. THE SYSTEM IS EQUIPPED WITH A USER-FRIENDLY HUMAN COMPUTER INTERFACE (HCI) FOR COMMUNICATION WITH THE FARM BASE. THIS MULTIDRONE SYSTEM CAN PROCESS VAST AREAS OF FARMLAND DAILY. THE IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUE PROPOSED IN THIS PAPER IS A MODIFIED RESNET ARCHITECTURE. THE SYSTEM IS COMPARED WITH DEEP CNN ARCHITECTURE AND OTHER MACHINE LEARNING BASED SYSTEMS. THE RESNET ARCHITECTURE ACHIEVES THE HIGHEST AVERAGE ACCURACY OF 99.78% ON A DATASET CONSISTING OF 70,295 LEAF IMAGES FOR 26 DIFFERENT DISEASES OF 14 PLANTS.

THESE WEEDS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE YIELD AND QUALITY OF THE FARM OUTPUT. UNFORTUNATELY, SITE-SPECIFIC WEED MANAGEMENT IS NOT FOLLOWED IN MOST OF THE CASES. THAT IS, INSTEAD OF TREATING A FIELD WITH A SPECIFIC TYPE OF HERBICIDE, THE FIELD IS TREATED WITH A BROADCAST HERBICIDE APPLICATION. THIS BROADCAST APPLICATION OF THE HERBICIDE HAS RESULTED IN HERBICIDE-RESISTANT WEEDS AND HAS MANY ILL EFFECTS ON THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. THIS HAS PROMPTED MANY RESEARCH STUDIES TO SEEK THE MOST EFFECTIVE WEED MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES. ONE SUCH TECHNIQUE IS COMPUTER VISION-BASED AUTOMATIC WEED DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION. USING THIS TECHNIQUE, WEEDS CAN BE DETECTED AND IDENTIFIED AND A SUITABLE HERBICIDE CAN BE RECOMMENDED TO THE FARMERS. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE COMPUTER VISION TECHNIQUE TO SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFY AND CLASSIFY THE CROPS AND WEEDS FROM THE DIGITAL IMAGES. THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE MULTIPLE CLASSIFIER SYSTEMS BUILT USING SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES AND RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIERS FOR PLANT CLASSIFICATION IN CLASSIFYING PADDY CROPS AND WEEDS FROM DIGITAL IMAGES. DIGITAL IMAGES OF PADDY CROPS AND WEEDS FROM THE PADDY FIELDS WERE ACQUIRED USING THREE DIFFERENT CAMERAS FIXED AT DIFFERENT HEIGHTS FROM THE GROUND. TEXTURE, COLOR, AND SHAPE FEATURES WERE EXTRACTED FROM THE DIGITAL IMAGES AFTER BACKGROUND SUBTRACTION AND USED FOR CLASSIFICATION. A SIMPLE AND NEW METHOD WAS USED AS A DECISION FUNCTION IN THE MULTIPLE CLASSIFIER SYSTEMS. AN ACCURACY OF 91.36% WAS OBTAINED BY THE MULTIPLE CLASSIFIER SYSTEMS AND WAS FOUND TO OUTPERFORM SINGLE CLASSIFIER SYSTEMS.

"LI Y;CHAO X";ANNBASED CONTINUAL CLASSIFICATION IN AGRICULTURE;"IN THE AREA OF PLANT PROTECTION AND PRECISION FARMING, TIMELY DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF PLANT DISEASES AND CROP PESTS PLAY CRUCIAL ROLES IN THE MANAGEMENT AND DECISION-MAKING. RECENTLY, THERE HAVE BEEN MANY ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK (ANN) METHODS USED IN AGRICULTURAL CLASSIFICATION TASKS, WHICH ARE TASK SPECIFIC AND REQUIRE BIG DATASETS. THESE TWO CHARACTERISTICS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM HOW HUMANS LEARN INTELLIGENTLY. UNDOUBTEDLY, IT WOULD BE EXCITING IF THE MODELS CAN ACCUMULATE KNOWLEDGE TO HANDLE CONTINUAL TASKS. TOWARDS THIS GOAL, WE PROPOSE AN ANN-BASED CONTINUAL CLASSIFICATION METHOD VIA MEMORY STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL, WITH TWO CLEAR ADVANTAGES: FEW DATA AND HIGH FLEXIBILITY. THIS PROPOSED ANN-BASED MODEL COMBINES A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) AND GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORK (GAN). THROUGH LEARNING OF THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN INPUT PAIRED DATA, THE CNN PART ONLY REQUIRES FEW RAW DATA TO ACHIEVE A GOOD PERFORMANCE, SUITABLE FOR A CLASSIFICATION TASK. THE GAN PART IS USED TO EXTRACT IMPORTANT INFORMATION FROM OLD TASKS AND GENERATE ABSTRACTED IMAGES AS MEMORY FOR THE FUTURE TASK. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE REGULAR CNN MODEL PERFORMS POORLY ON THE CONTINUAL TASKS (PEST AND PLANT CLASSIFICATION), DUE TO THE FORGETTING PROBLEM. HOWEVER, OUR PROPOSED METHOD CAN DISTINGUISH ALL THE CATEGORIES FROM NEW AND OLD TASKS WITH GOOD PERFORMANCE, OWING TO ITS ABILITY OF ACCUMULATING KNOWLEDGE AND ALLEVIATING FORGETTING. THERE ARE SO MANY POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS OF THIS PROPOSED APPROACH IN THE AGRICULTURAL FIELD, FOR INSTANCE, THE INTELLIGENT FRUIT PICKING ROBOTS, WHICH CAN RECOGNIZE AND PICK DIFFERENT KINDS OF FRUITS; THE PLANT PROTECTION IS ACHIEVED BY AUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION OF DISEASES AND PESTS, WHICH CAN CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE THE DETECTION RANGE.

THE ADVANCEMENT OF MACHINE LEARNING PROVIDES A PATH FOR RESEARCHERS TO EXPLORE MORE DEEPLY THE FIELD OF DEEP LEARNING. IMAGE PROCESSING CAN BE USED FOR THE RECOGNITION, IDENTIFICATION, AND CLASSIFICATION OF PLANTS. IN THIS PAPER DIFFERENT FEATURES OF PLANTS SUCH AS HEIGHT, PERIMETER, WIDTH, AREA, ASPECT RATIO, RECTANGULARITY, ETC. ARE USED TO CLASSIFY THE PLANTS BASED ON LEAF IMAGES AND USING MULTIPLE MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES. DIFFERENT SUPERVISED LEARNING CLASSIFIERS SUCH AS RANDOM FOREST, K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR, NAÃVE BAYES, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE, AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION ARE USED TO RECOGNIZE THE PLANT, AND THEIR RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED TO BUILD AN AUTOMATIC RECOGNITION SYSTEM. FLAVIA, MENDELEY, AND SELF-CREATED DATASETS ARE USED FOR ANALYSIS. SVM MODEL PRODUCED MAXIMUM ACCURACY OF 95% FOR FLAVIA DATASET, 94% FOR SELF-CREATED DATASET WHEREAS MENDELEY DATASET RESULTED IN 89% ACCURACY.

IN THESE AYURVEDA METHODS IDENTIFICATION OF INDIGENOUS PLANTS TO PREDICT THE MEDICINES IS VERY IMPORTANT AND MUST DO VERY CAREFULLY. GENERALLY MAIN COMPONENTS THAT WE USE TO IDENTIFY A PLANT ARE LEAF, FLOWER, TRUNK AND ROOT ETC. AMONG THESE FEATURES, WE USE IMAGES OF LEAVES AND FLOWERS. TO DO THIS WE ARE USING DEEP LEARNING BASED CNN APPROACHES AND MACHINE LEARNING AND TECHNOLOGIES. THOSE ARE OPENCV, AND TENSORFLOW CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM. ACCORDING TO THE EVIDENCES THAT WE GATHERED FROM SURVEYS AND INTERVIEWS THAT WE CONDUCTED WITH THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WE COULD FIND OUT THAT LOTS OF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE MUCH KNOWLEDGE ABOUT INDIGENOUS MEDICINAL PLANTS AND THEIR AYURVEDA TREATMENT METHODS. TO OVERCOME THIS PROBLEM WE IMPLEMENTED AYURVEDA INFORMATION CENTRALIZED CHATBOT WHICH IS ABLE TO ANSWER USER'S QUESTIONS RELEVANT TO THE AYURVEDA AND INDIGENOUS MEDICINAL PLANTS. CHATBOT WILL ANALYZE THE QUESTION THAT USER ASKS AND WILL PROVIDE ANSWERS ACCORDING TO THAT. ANOTHER USEFUL FEATURE OF THIS SYSTEM IS IT PROVIDES RELEVANT INFORMATION OF AYURVEDA DOCTORS. SO USERS CAN FIND DOCTORS ACCORDING TO THEIR NEEDS AND THEY ARE ABLE TO RATE AND GIVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE DOCTORS. THAT WILL BE HELP OTHERS TO FIND DOCTORS MORE EASILY AND EFFICIENTLY WITHOUT ANY DOUBT.

"MINOWA Y;SHIGEMATSU K;TAKAHARA H";A DEEP LEARNINGBASED MODEL FOR TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION USING POLLEN GRAIN IMAGES;THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEVELOP A DEEP LEARNING-BASED TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION MODEL USING POLLEN GRAIN IMAGES TAKEN WITH A CAMERA MOUNTED ON AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE. FROM FIVE FOCAL POINTS, WE TOOK PHOTOGRAPHS OF POLLEN COLLECTED FROM TREE SPECIES WIDELY DISTRIBUTED IN THE JAPANESE ARCHIPELAGO, AND WE USED THESE TO PRODUCE POLLEN IMAGES. WE USED CAFFE AS THE DEEP LEARNING FRAMEWORK AND ALEXNET AND GOOGLENET AS THE DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS. WE CONSTRUCTED FOUR LEARNING MODELS THAT COMBINED TWO LEARNING PATTERNS, ONE FOR FOCAL POINT IMAGES WITH DATA AUGMENTATION, FOR WHICH THE TRAINING AND TEST DATA WERE THE SAME, AND THE OTHER WITHOUT DATA AUGMENTATION, FOR WHICH THEY WERE NOT THE SAME. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED MODEL WAS EVALUATED ACCORDING TO THE MCC AND F SCORE. THE MOST ACCURATE CLASSIFICATION MODEL WAS BASED ON THE GOOGLENET ALGORITHM, WITH DATA AUGMENTATION AFTER 200 EPOCHS. TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION ACCURACY VARIED DEPENDING ON THE FOCAL POINT, EVEN FOR THE SAME POLLEN GRAIN, AND IMAGES FOCUSING ON THE POLLEN SURFACE TENDED TO BE MORE ACCURATELY CLASSIFIED THAN THOSE FOCUSING ON THE POLLEN OUTLINE AND MEMBRANE STRUCTURE. CASTANEA CRENATA, FRAXINUS SIEBOLDIANA, AND QUERCUS CRISPULA POLLEN GRAINS WERE CLASSIFIED WITH THE HIGHEST ACCURACY, WHEREAS GAMBLEA INNOVANS, CARPINUS TSCHONOSKII, CORNUS CONTROVERSA, FAGUS JAPONICA, QUERCUS SERRATA, AND QUERCUS SESSILIFOLIA SHOWED THE LOWEST CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS A PRIME CANDIDATE TO OVERCOME TWO CHALLENGES FACED BY FARMERS AROUND THE WORLD: THE INCREASING COST AND DECREASING AVAILABILITY OF HUMAN LABOR FOR WEED CONTROL, AND THE GROWING GLOBAL RESTRICTION OF HERBICIDES. DEEP LEARNING IS ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT APPROACHES FOR APPLYING AI TO ALL KINDS OF USE CASES IN INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS, ENTERTAINMENT, AND SECURITY. ITS LATEST FIELD OF APPLICATION IS PLANT CLASSIFICATION THAT ENABLES AUTOMATED WEED CONTROL AND PRECISE SPOT SPRAYING OF HERBICIDES. WHILE CHEAP, POWERFUL PLATFORMS FOR DEPLOYING CLASSIFICATION MECHANISMS ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE, THIS COMES AT THE COST OF EXPENSIVE AND EFFORT RICH CLASSIFIER TRAINING. THIS EFFECTIVELY MAKES DEEP LEARNING-BASED APPROACHES UNAVAILABLE FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. DEEPFIELD ROBOTICS PRESENTS A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH FOR DEPLOYING AI ONTO FIELDS AT LARGE, INCLUDING THE LEARNINGS THAT LED TO THEIR SELF-CONTAINED AI DRIVEN PLANT CLASSIFICATION MODULES THAT RELIEVE INDIVIDUALS FROM HAVING TO DEPLOY THEIR OWN AI SOLUTION.

HOWEVER, THIS PROFUSION OF DATA ONLY CONCERNS A FEW TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SPECIES, MOSTLY LOCATED IN NORTH AMERICA AND WESTERN EUROPE, MUCH LESS IN THE RICHEST REGIONS IN TERMS OF BIODIVERSITY SUCH AS TROPICAL COUNTRIES. ON THE OTHER HAND, FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES, BOTANISTS HAVE COLLECTED, CATALOGUED AND SYSTEMATICALLY STORED PLANT SPECIMENS IN HERBARIA, PARTICULARLY IN TROPICAL REGIONS, AND THE RECENT EFFORTS BY THE BIODIVERSITY INFORMATICS COMMUNITY MADE IT POSSIBLE TO PUT MILLIONS OF DIGITIZED SHEETS ONLINE. THE LIFECLEF 2020 PLANT IDENTIFICATION CHALLENGE (ORâ€PLANTCLEF 2020â€) WAS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE TO WHAT EXTENT AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION ON THE FLORA OF DATA DEFICIENT REGIONS CAN BE IMPROVED BY THE USE OF HERBARIUM COLLECTIONS. IT IS BASED ON A DATASET OF ABOUT 1,000 SPECIES MAINLY FOCUSED ON THE SOUTH AMERICAâ€™S GUIANA SHIELD, AN AREA KNOWN TO HAVE ONE OF THE GREATEST DIVERSITY OF PLANTS IN THE WORLD. THE CHALLENGE WAS EVALUATED AS A CROSS-DOMAIN CLASSIFICATION TASK WHERE THE TRAINING SET CONSIST OF SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND HERBARIUM SHEETS AND FEW THOUSAND OF PHOTOS TO ENABLE LEARNING A MAPPING BETWEEN THE TWO DOMAINS.

"KAZEROUNI M;SCHLEMPER J;KUHNERT K";AUTOMATIC PLANT RECOGNITION SYSTEM FOR CHALLENGING NATURAL PLANT SPECIES;PHOTOSYNTHESIS IS ONE OF TURNING POINTS TO SHAPE THE WORLD. PLANTS USE THIS PROCESS TO CONVERT LIGHT ENERGY INTO CHEMICAL ENERGY. SOME OF THE EARLY MICROORGANISMS EVOLVED A WAY TO USE THE ENERGY FROM SUNLIGHT TO MAKE SUGAR OUT OF SIMPLER MOLECULES, BUT UNLIKE GREEN PLANTS TODAY, THE FIRST PHOTOSYNTHESIZING ORGANISMS DID NOT RELEASE OXYGEN AS WASTE PRODUCT, SO THERE WAS NO OXYGEN IN THE AIR. PLANTS ARE VERY BUSY FACTORIES AND LEAVES ARE THE MAIN PLACE FOR PRODUCTION. A USEFUL PLANT RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS CAPABLE OF IDENTIFICATION OF DIFFERENT SPECIES IN NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. IN NATURAL ENVIRONMENT, PLANTS AND LEAVES GROW IN DIFFERENT REGIONS AND CLIMATES. DURING DAY, VARIATION OF LIGHT INTENSITY CAN BE CONSIDERED AS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR. THUS, RECOGNITION OF SPECIES IN DIFFERENT CONDITIONS IS A REAL NEED AS PLANTS ARE UBIQUITOUS IN HUMAN LIFE. A DATASET OF NATURAL IMAGES HAS BEEN UTILIZED. THE DATASET CONTAINS FOUR DIFFERENT PLANT SPECIES OF SIEGERLAND, GERMANY. MODERN COMBINED DESCRIPTION ALGORITHMS, SURF, FAST-SURF, AND HARRIS-SURF, HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT TO IMPLEMENT A RELIABLE SYSTEM FOR PLANTS SPECIES RECOGNITION AND CLASSIFICATION IN NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. ONE OF WELL KNOWN METHODS IN MACHINE LEARNING COMMUNITY, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE, HAS BEEN APPLIED IN THE IMPLEMENTED SYSTEMS. ALL STEPS OF SYSTEM'S IMPLEMENTATION ARE DESCRIBED IN RELATED SECTIONS.

MANY OF THESE PLANTS ARE USED IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY AS INDUSTRIAL CROPS. GROWING AUTOMATION IN INDUSTRIES INCLUDING COMMERCE AND MEDICINE HAS MADE ACCURATE LEAF IDENTIFICATION CRUCIAL. LEAVES ARE TYPICALLY CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO MORPHOLOGICAL OR GENETIC CHARACTERISTICS. AS A RESULT OF THEIR NUMEROUS PHYSICAL DIFFERENCES, HOWEVER, IT IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO CATEGORIZE THE DIVERSE LEAF CULTIVARS THAT EXIST. SEVERAL EVOLUTIONARY SHIFTS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES HAVE RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF VARIANTS OF A CERTAIN LEAF TYPE. TO MANUALLY SIFT AND IDENTIFY THESE LEAVES IS A LABORIOUS PROCESS. A NOVEL HYBRID GOS ALGORITHM IS PROPOSED IN THIS STUDY FOR DETECTING LEAVES BASED ON THEIR SHAPE, COLOR, AND TEXTURE. THREE TYPES OF LEAVES (APPLE, CUCUMBER, AND MANGO) ARE USED AS EXAMPLES, AND FEATURES FOR EACH ARE EXTRACTED USING IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES, BEFORE BEING OPTIMIZED WITH THE GREY WOLF OPTIMIZER AND FINALLY CLASSIFIED WITH THE SVM (SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE) CLASSIFIER ALGORITHM.

THREE DIFFERENT APPROACHES ARE EXPLORED THAT PROVIDE ESTIMATIONS OF ABUNDANCE AND SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION AT VARYING LEVELS OF GRANULARITY DEFINED BY SPATIAL RESOLUTION. IN THE COARSEST-GRAINED APPROACH, CNNS ARE TASKED WITH IDENTIFYING WHICH OF SIX PLANT SPECIES ARE PRESENT/ABSENT IN LARGE PATCHES WITHIN THE SALT MARSH IMAGES. CNNS WITH DIVERSE TOPOLOGICAL PROPERTIES AND ATTENTION MECHANISMS ARE SHOWN CAPABLE OF PROVIDING ACCURATE ESTIMATIONS WITH > 90% PRECISION AND RECALL FOR THE MORE ABUNDANT PLANT SPECIES AND REDUCED PERFORMANCE FOR LESS COMMON PLANT SPECIES. ESTIMATION OF PERCENT COVER OF EACH PLANT SPECIES IS PERFORMED AT A FINER SPATIAL RESOLUTION, WHERE SMALLER IMAGE PATCHES ARE EXTRACTED AND THE CNNS TASKED WITH IDENTIFYING THE PLANT SPECIES OR SUBSTRATE AT THE CENTER OF THE IMAGE PATCH. FOR THE PERCENT COVER ESTIMATION TASK, THE CNNS ARE OBSERVED TO EXHIBIT A PERFORMANCE PROFILE SIMILAR TO THAT FOR THE PRESENCE/ABSENCE ESTIMATION TASK, BUT WITH AN â‰ˆ 5%-10% REDUCTION IN PRECISION AND RECALL.

LAKES AND RIVERS, AQUATIC PLANTS MAY GROW RAPIDLY AND CAUSE SERIOUS ECOLOGICAL PROBLEMS. THEREFORE, THE MEASUREMENT AND EVALUATION OF THE UNDERWATER PLANTS ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION OF SHALLOW WATERS. ULTRASONIC SENSORS ARE WIDELY USED TO DETECT UNDERWATER OBJECTS DUE TO THE ADVANTAGES OF LOW COST AND REAL-TIME MONITORING. THIS PAPER DEVELOPS AN ECHO-LOCATION MEASUREMENT SYSTEM WHICH INCLUDES THE ACOUSTIC SOURCE, THE PROPAGATION MODEL OF THE WATER MEDIA AND THE SOUND ABSORPTION MODEL OF THE AQUATIC PLANTS AND SEDIMENTS. THE PROPOSED SOUND ABSORPTION MODEL SHOWS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOUND ABSORPTION COEFFICIENTS AND THE AMOUNT OF PLANT. EXPERIMENTS ARE THEN CARRIED OUT TO MEASURE AND IDENTIFY THE SOUND ABSORPTION COEFFICIENTS OF THE PLANT SAMPLES. CONSIDERING VARIATIONS OF DIFFERENT KIND OF PLANTS, A DEEP LEARNING METHOD IS EMPLOYED TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENT PLANTS AND ELIMINATE THE DIFFERENCES IN EXPERIMENTS.

PLANTS ARE IDENTIFIED FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES. WIDE VARIETIES OF PLANT SPECIES ARE AVAILABLE IN NATURE. BOTANISTS ARE RESEARCH PLANTS TO CLASSIFY PLANT SPECIES IN THE WILD AND TAKE THEIR BENEFITS OUT. THERE IS A LOT OF DEMAND FOR IDENTIFYING PLANT SPECIES MANUALLY OR VISUALLY INSPECTING THEIR CHARACTERISTICS, STUDY THEIR AVAILABILITY ON VARIOUS GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATIONS TO REAP THEIR BENEFITS EFFECTIVELY.

IN THIS PAPER WE PRESENT AN APPROACH BASED ON A MATRIX DESCRIPTOR, THE LOCAL PHASE QUANTIZATION, FOR IMPROVING THE PERFORMANCE OF SUCH WIDELY USED SHAPE DESCRIPTORS AS THE INNER DISTANCE SHAPE CONTEXT (ID), SHAPER CONTEXT (SC), AND HEIGHT FUNCTIONS (HF). THE BASIC IDEA OF OUR NOVEL APPROACH IS TO TRANSFORM THE SHAPE DESCRIPTOR OBTAINED BY ID/SC/HF INTO A MATRIX SO THAT MATRIX DESCRIPTORS CAN BE EXTRACTED. THESE MATRIX DESCRIPTORS ARE THEN COMPARED WITH THE JEFFREY DISTANCE AND COMBINED WITH STANDARD ID/SC/HF SHAPE SIMILARITY. SINCE IT HAS RECENTLY BEEN SHOWN THAT ID/SC/HF SHAPE SIMILARITIES CAN BE COUPLED WITH LEARNING CONTEXT-SENSITIVE SHAPE SIMILARITY USING GRAPH TRANSDUCTION (LGT) FOR IMPROVING THE RESULTS, WE HAVE ALSO COUPLED OUR APPROACH WITH LGT. OUR PROPOSED APPROACH IS TESTED ON A WIDE VARIETY OF SHAPE DATABASES INCLUDING MPEG7 CE-SHAPE-1, KIMIA SILHOUETTES, TARI DATASET, A LEAF DATASET, A TOOLS DATASET, A MYTHS FIGURES DATASET, AND OUR NEW HUMAN DANCER DATASET.

"KUTHA K N;HERDIYENI Y;SILALAHI B";PARALLEL TECHNIQUE FOR MEDICINAL PLANT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM USING FUZZY LOCAL BINARY PATTERN;AS BIOLOGICAL IMAGE DATABASES ARE GROWING RAPIDLY, AUTOMATED SPECIES IDENTIFICATION BASED ON DIGITAL DATA BECOMES OF GREAT INTEREST FOR ACCELERATING BIODIVERSITY ASSESSMENT, RESEARCH AND MONITORING. THIS RESEARCH APPLIED HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING (HPC) TO A MEDICINAL PLANT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM. A PARALLEL TECHNIQUE FOR MEDICINAL PLANT IMAGE PROCESSING USING FUZZY LOCAL BINARY PATTERN (FLBP) IS PROPOSED. THE FLBP METHOD EXTENDS THE LOCAL BINARY PATTERN (LBP) APPROACH BY EMPLOYING FUZZY LOGIC TO REPRESENT TEXTURE IMAGES. THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO MEASURE THE EFFICIENCY OF USING THE PROPOSED PARALLEL TECHNIQUE FOR MEDICINAL PLANT IMAGE PROCESSING AND EVALUATION IN ORDER TO FIND OUT WHETHER THIS APPROACH IS REASONABLE FOR HANDLING LARGE DATA SETS. THE PARALLEL PROCESSING TECHNIQUE WAS DESIGNED IN A MESSAGE-SENDING MODEL. 30 SPECIES OF INDONESIAN MEDICAL PLANTS WERE ANALYZED. EACH SPECIES WAS REPRESENTED BY 48 LEAF IMAGES. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION WAS MEASURED USING THE SPEED-UP, EFFICIENCY, AND ISOEFFICIENCY OF THE PARALLEL COMPUTING TECHNIQUE. PRELIMINARY RESULTS SHOW THAT HPC WORKED WELL IN REDUCING THE EXECUTION TIME OF MEDICAL PLANT IDENTIFICATION. IN THIS WORK, PARALLEL PROCESSING OF TRAINING IMAGES WAS 7.64 TIMES FASTER THAN WITH SEQUENTIAL PROCESSING, WITH EFFICIENCY VALUES GREATER THAN 0.9. PARALLEL PROCESSING OF TESTING IMAGES WAS 6.73 TIMES FASTER THAN WITH SEQUENTIAL PROCESSING, WITH EFFICIENCY VALUES OVER 0.9. THE SYSTEM WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY IMAGES WITH AN ACCURACY OF 68.89%.

"PANG P;LIM K";REVIEW ON AUTOMATIC PLANT IDENTIFICATION USING COMPUTER VISION APPROACHES;PLANTS ARE CRUCIAL RESOURCES ON THE EARTH FOR ECOLOGICAL LIVING HABITAT. HOWEVER, THE RAPID LOSS OF PLANT SPECIES HAS ALERTED THE GLOBE WITH THE RISING AWARENESS OF BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION. RETHE NEED OF PLANT IDENTIFICATION PROVIDES AN ESSENTIAL BIOLOGIST INFORMATION FOR PLANT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. IT HAS BROUGHT SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION AND EXPLORATION. NEVERTHELESS, IT REQUIRES SPECIES IDENTIFICATION SKILLS, HIGH TIME CONSUMPTION ON STUDY THE SPECIES AND USAGE OF SPECIFIC BOTANICAL TERMS. THE KNOWLEDGE OF PLANT IDENTIFICATION IS NOT ONLY FOR BOTANIST AND PLANT ECOLOGISTS, BUT IT IS ALSO USEFUL FOR SOCIETY, FROM PROFESSIONALS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. THE CHALLENGES OF PLANT IDENTIFICATION IS THE COMPLEXITY OF GAINING PLANT SPECIES KNOWLEDGE. CURRENTLY, WITH RELEVANT TECHNOLOGIES (DIGITAL CAMERAS, MOBILE DEVICES AND REMOTE ACCESS TO DATABASES) AND COMPUTER VISION TECHNIQUES, IT HAVE CREATED AN AUTOMATED PLANT IDENTIFICATION TO EASE THE SOCIETY IN PLANT IDENTIFICATION. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO DOCUMENT AN ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON OF STUDIES BETWEEN TWO TYPES COMPUTER VISION APPROACHES FOR PLANT SPECIES IDENTIFICATION AND THE FEATURES, I.E., SHAPE, TEXTURE, COLOUR, MARGIN, AND VEIN STRUCTURE.

PHYTOPHTHORA INFESTANS, THE CAUSAL PATHOGEN OF TOMATO LATE BLIGHT, COULD DISSEMINATE TO ALL THE CULTIVATION REGIONS IN A SUITABLE WEATHER CONDITION AND DESTROY ALL THE CROP IN WEEKS. IN ORDER TO PREVENT SEVERE DISEASE SPREADING, EARLY SYMPTOM IDENTIFICATION OF THE DISEASE IS IMPORTANT TO TAKE ACTIONS FOR DISEASE CONTROL. LATE BLIGHT SYMPTOMS INCLUDE FROM IRREGULARLY SHAPED WATER-SOAKED TO BROWN NECROTIC LESIONS ON PLANT LEAVES AND STEMS. CONVENTIONALLY, THE IDENTIFICATION OF LATE BLIGHT DEEPLY RELIES ON THE EXPERIENCE OF TOMATO FARMERS. HOWEVER, THE SYMPTOMS OF LATE BLIGHT MIGHT BE CONFUSED WITH THE ATYPICAL SYMPTOMS AND LESIONS OF SOME OTHER DISEASES, CONFUSING NOT ONLY THE WELL-EXPERIENCED FARMERS BUT ALSO THE INEXPERIENCED PLANT PATHOLOGISTS. THIS STUDY PROPOSED TO IDENTIFY TOMATO LATE BLIGHT USING LEAF IMAGES AND DEEP LEARNING. A NAVIGATOR-TEACHER-SCRUTINIZER NETWORK (NTS-NET) WAS DEVELOPED TO LOCALIZE AND IDENTIFY THE PUTATIVE LATE BLIGHT LESIONS OF TOMATO LEAVES.

"LEE C;LIM K;SONG Y;ALQAHTANI A";PLANTCNNVIT PLANT CLASSIFICATION WITH ENSEMBLE OF CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS AND VISION TRANSFORMER;PLANT LEAF CLASSIFICATION INVOLVES IDENTIFYING AND CATEGORIZING PLANT SPECIES BASED ON LEAF CHARACTERISTICS, SUCH AS PATTERNS, SHAPES, TEXTURES, AND VEINS. IN RECENT YEARS, RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF PLANT CLASSIFICATION USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES. THIS INVOLVES TRAINING MODELS ON LARGE DATASETS OF PLANT IMAGES AND USING THEM TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENT PLANT SPECIES. HOWEVER, THESE MODELS ARE LIMITED BY THEIR RELIANCE ON LARGE AMOUNTS OF TRAINING DATA, WHICH CAN BE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN FOR MANY PLANT SPECIES. TO OVERCOME THIS CHALLENGE, THIS PAPER PROPOSES A PLANT-CNN-VIT ENSEMBLE MODEL THAT COMBINES THE STRENGTHS OF FOUR PRE-TRAINED MODELS: VISION TRANSFORMER, RESNET-50, DENSENET-201, AND XCEPTION. VISION TRANSFORMER UTILIZES SELF-ATTENTION TO CAPTURE DEPENDENCIES AND FOCUS ON IMPORTANT LEAF FEATURES. RESNET-50 INTRODUCES RESIDUAL CONNECTIONS, AIDING IN EFFICIENT TRAINING AND HIERARCHICAL FEATURE EXTRACTION. DENSENET-201 EMPLOYS DENSE CONNECTIONS, FACILITATING INFORMATION FLOW AND CAPTURING INTRICATE LEAF PATTERNS. XCEPTION USES SEPARABLE CONVOLUTIONS, REDUCING THE COMPUTATIONAL COST WHILE CAPTURING FINE-GRAINED DETAILS IN LEAF IMAGES. THE PROPOSED PLANT-CNN-VIT WAS EVALUATED ON FOUR PLANT LEAF DATASETS AND ACHIEVED REMARKABLE ACCURACY OF 100.00%, 100.00%, 100.00%, AND 99.83% ON THE FLAVIA DATASET, FOLIO LEAF DATASET, SWEDISH LEAF DATASET, AND MALAYAKEW LEAF DATASET, RESPECTIVELY.

THE PROPOSED AUTOMATIC FLOWER BOUNDARY EXTRACTION METHOD CONSISTS OF TWO MAJOR PROCEDURES: THE DETECTION OF FOUR EDGE POINTS AND BOUNDARY TRACING. FLOWER RECOGNITION INCLUDES TWO STAGES: FEATURE EXTRACTION AND MATCHING. FOR THE FLOWER BOUNDARY EXTRACTION PORTION, WE PRESENT A NEW TECHNIQUE FOR AUTOMATICALLY IDENTIFYING A FLOWER'S BOUNDARY IN AN IMAGE. FOR BOUNDARY TRACING, AN INTELLIGENT SCISSORS ALGORITHM IS APPLIED. THE COLOR GRADIENT MAGNITUDE COST TERM IS IMPLEMENTED SO THAT IT CAN ACT DIRECTLY ON THE THREE COMPONENTS OF THE COLOR IMAGE. SUGGESTED EXTRACTION OF THE CHARACTERISTICS HAS USED DIVISION OF THE IMAGE IN THREE LEVELS (LEVEL 1, LEVEL 2, AND LEVEL 3), THE RGB AND YCBCR OF EACH LEVEL, THE MINIMUM EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE VALUE OF EIGHT COLORS, AND THE NUMBER OF PETALS.

FOR THIS REASON, IT IS IMPORTANT TO OBTAIN SIGNATURES THAT CAN MODEL THE TARGET IN BEST WAY WHILE CREATING SPECTRAL LIBRARY SIGNATURES. IN THIS STUDY, A REPRESENTATIVE SIGNATURE GENERATION METHOD FOR THE PATTERNED OBJECTS IS PROPOSED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE TARGET IN HYPERSPECTRAL AERIAL IMAGES. THE TARGET DETECTION PERFORMANCE, WHICH WAS CALCULATED BY USING THE PATTERN SIGNATURES OF THE OBJECT IS COMPARED WITH THE TARGET DETECTION PERFORMANCE USING THE MEAN SIGNATURES OBTAINED BY THE AVERAGE OF THE SIGNATURES FROM A SELECTED AREA. IN ADDITION, THE TARGET DETECTION PERFORMANCE OF THE AVERAGE SIGNATURES OBTAINED FROM RANDOMLY SELECTED AREAS ARE ALSO COMPARED.

"NETO J;MEYER G;JONES D";INDIVIDUAL LEAF EXTRACTIONS FROM YOUNG CANOPY IMAGES USING GUSTAFSONKESSEL CLUSTERING AND A GENETIC ALGORITHM;THE EXTRACTION OF INDIVIDUAL CONCEALED LEAVES FROM IMAGES OF COMPLEX PLANT CANOPIES IS A NECESSARY STEP FOR TAXONOMIC FEATURE ACQUISITION, SPECIES IDENTIFICATION, AND MAPPING USING A MODERN PERSONAL COMPUTER. A NEW SYSTEM FOR INDIVIDUAL LEAFLET EXTRACTION WAS DEVELOPED AND TESTED, BASED ON CONNECTED COMPONENTS, FUZZY CLUSTERING AND A GENETIC OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM. COLOR IMAGES WERE TAKEN OF YOUNG, BUT SPARSE GREEN CANOPIES, GROWN IN BOTH GREENHOUSE AND FIELD CONDITIONS. SOME IMAGES CONTAINED INDIVIDUAL LEAVES AS CONNECTED COMPONENTS, WHICH WERE READILY APPARENT AFTER SEPARATION OF THE VEGETATION FROM ITS BACKGROUND. FRAGMENTS OF ALL OTHER LEAVES IMBEDDED IN THE CANOPY WERE OBTAINED USING THE GUSTAFSON-KESSEL (GK) CLUSTERING ALGORITHM. EACH LEAF FRAGMENT WAS LABELED AND PLACED IN A VARIABLE LENGTH DATA STRUCTURE CALLED A CHROMOSOME, WHICH REPRESENTED SELECTED LEAF FRAGMENTS AND ITS NEIGHBORS. A GENETIC ALGORITHM WAS THEN USED TO SYSTEMATICALLY REASSEMBLE THE FRAGMENTS OF NON-OCCLUDED, INDIVIDUAL LEAVES. SYSTEM PERFORMANCE WAS EVALUATED BY COMPARING THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL LEAVES EXTRACTED BY THE COMPUTER PER PLANT OR PLANT CANOPY CONNECTED COMPONENT FOR VARIOUS SOIL/RESIDUE BACKGROUNDS AND TIME AFTER EMERGENCE. 83.5% OF THE PLANTS IN THE SECOND WEEK PRODUCED AT LEAST ONE COMPUTER-EXTRACTED LEAF FOR IDENTIFICATION. NINTY-TWO PERCENT OF THE PLANTS HAD AT LEAST ONE COMPUTER EXTRACTED LEAF BY THE THIRD WEEK. 84.7% HAD MORE THAN THREE COMPUTER EXTRACTED LEAVES FOR IDENTIFICATION IN THE THIRD WEEK. IMAGES OF YOUNG FIELD PLANTS IN MULTIPLE SPECIES CLUSTERS RESULTED IN A 46% LEAF EXTRACTION RATE, BUT WITH AT LEAST ONE LEAF PER CONNECTED CANOPY COMPONENT. SOYBEAN AND VELVETLEAF LEAFLETS WERE THE EASIEST TO EXTRACT. ONCE INDIVIDUAL LEAVES ARE EXTRACTED, THEY CAN BE CLASSIFIED USING TRADITIONAL SHAPE AND TEXTURAL FEATURE METHODS.

CURRENTLY, MOST SPECTRAL LIBRARIES ARE DESIGNED TO SUPPORT THE CLASSIFICATION OF LAND COVER TYPES, WHEREAS FEW ARE DEDICATED TO AGRICULTURAL REMOTE SENSING MONITORING. HERE, WE GATHERED SPECTRAL OBSERVATION DATA ON PLANTS IN MULTIPLE EXPERIMENTAL SCENARIOS INTO A SPECTRAL DATABASE TO INVESTIGATE METHODS FOR CROP CLASSIFICATION (16 CROP SPECIES) AND STATUS MONITORING (TEA PLANT AND RICE GROWTH). WE PROPOSED A SET OF SCREENING METHODS FOR SPECTRAL FEATURES RELATED TO PLANT CLASSIFICATION AND STATUS MONITORING (BAND REFLECTANCE, VEGETATION INDEX, SPECTRAL DIFFERENTIATION, SPECTRAL CONTINUUM CHARACTERISTICS) THAT ARE BASED ON ISODATA AND JM DISTANCE. NEXT, WE INVESTIGATED THE PERFORMANCE OF DIFFERENT MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFIERS IN THE SPECTRAL LIBRARY APPLICATION, INCLUDING K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR (KNN), RANDOM FOREST (RF), AND A GENETIC ALGORITHM COUPLED WITH A SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (GA-SVM). THE OPTIMAL COMBINATION OF SPECTRAL FEATURES AND THE CLASSIFIER WITH THE HIGHEST CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY WERE SELECTED FOR CROP CLASSIFICATION AND STATUS MONITORING SCENARIOS. THE GA-SVM CLASSIFIER PERFORMED THE BEST, WHICH PRODUCED AN ACCURACY OF OAA = 0.94, KAPPA = 0.93 FOR CROP CLASSIFICATION IN A COMPLEX SCENARIO (CROPS MIXED WITH 71 NON-CROP PLANT SPECIES), AND PROMISING ACCURACIES FOR TEA PLANT GROWTH MONITORING (OAA = 0.98, KAPPA = 0.97) AND RICE GROWTH STAGE MONITORING (OAA = 0.92, KAPPA = 0.90).

"NGUYEN T;LE T;VU H;HOANG V";TOWARDS AN AUTOMATIC PLANT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM WITHOUT DEDICATED DATASET;A LARGE IMAGE DATASET PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN BUILDING AUTOMATIC VISION RECOGNITION SYSTEM. HOWEVER, COLLECTING AND LABELING DATA ARE TEDIOUS, LABORIOUS AND TIME-CONSUMING TASKS. IN SOME CASES, IT IS CHICKEN AND EGG PROBLEM: IT IS ONLY POSSIBLE TO GET APPLICATION DATA AFTER THE SYSTEM DEPLOYMENT. IN OUR STUDY, WE ARE INTERESTED IN BUILDING AUTOMATIC PLANT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS FROM IMAGES. AS PLANTS DISTRIBUTION ON THE WORLD IS NOT UNIFORM AND MAY CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES, THE AVAILABILITY OF SPECIES IN DIFFERENT AREAS IS DIFFERENT. THAT IS WHY SOME SPECIES ARE VERY ABUNDANT IN ONE REGION AND NON-EXISTING IN OTHERS REGIONS. EVEN THE DISTRIBUTION OF PLANT SPECIES IS DIVERSE, PLANT SPECIES IN THE PLANET SHARE COMMON FEATURES. THEY ALL HAVE ORGAN TYPES SUCH AS LEAF, FLOWER, ETC. TAKING INTO THIS OBSERVATION, IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A NEW APPROACH FOR BUILDING AN IMAGE-BASED PLANT IDENTIFICATION WITHOUT AN AVAILABLE IMAGE DATABASE BASED ON THE COMBINATION OF DEEP LEARNING, TRANSFER LEARNING, AND CROWD-SOURCING. THE PROPOSED APPROACH CONSISTS OF FOUR MAIN STEPS: PLANT ORGAN DETECTION, PLANT IMAGE COLLECTION, DATA VALIDATION AND PLANT IDENTIFICATION. PLANT ORGAN DETECTION AIMS TO LEARN ORGAN TYPE CHARACTERISTIC FROM AVAILABLE IMAGE DATASETS OF PLANTS WHILE THE PURPOSE OF THE DATA COLLECTION STEP IS TO CRAWL DATASET FROM CROWD-SOURCED SOURCES. THEN, PLANT ORGAN DETECTION WILL BE USED IN DATA VALIDATION IN ORDER TO REMOVE THE UNWANTED/INVALID IMAGES WHILE KEEPING THE VALID ONES.

ANY SUCCESSFUL VISUAL TRAIT SYSTEM REQUIRES AUTOMATED DATA STRUCTURING AND A DATA RETRIEVAL MODEL TO MANAGE, SEARCH, AND RETRIEVE UNSTRUCTURED AND COMPLEX IMAGE DATA. THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES A HIGHLY SCALABLE AND COMPUTATIONALLY EFFICIENT IMAGE RETRIEVAL SYSTEM FOR REAL-TIME CONTENT-BASED SEARCHING THROUGH LARGE-SCALE IMAGE REPOSITORIES IN THE DOMAIN OF REMOTE SENSING AND PLANT BIOLOGY. IMAGES ARE PROCESSED INDEPENDENTLY WITHOUT CONSIDERING ANY RELEVANT CONTEXT BETWEEN SUB-SETS OF IMAGES.

A DISEASED SEED POTATO CAN PRODUCE APPROXIMATELY 10 POTATO TUBERS, AND THE DISEASE CAN PROPAGATE THROUGH THE SEED POTATO PRODUCTION CYCLE. TO PROMOTE STABLE POTATO PRODUCTION, QUALITY SEED POTATOES THAT ARE HEALTHY AND DISEASE-FREE SHOULD BE SUPPLIED. THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED A PROPAGATION SYSTEM FOR THE PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF SEED POTATOES. EXPERIENCED LABORERS ARE REQUIRED IN THE FIELDS FOR VISUAL INSPECTION AND REMOVAL OF ABNORMAL PLANTS DURING SEED POTATO PRODUCTION. TO AID VISUAL DETECTION, REDUCE LABOR EFFORT, AND IMPROVE ASSESSMENT TIME, WE DEVELOPED AN AUTOMATED ABNORMAL POTATO PLANT DETECTION SYSTEM THAT UTILIZES A PORTABLE VIDEO CAMERA AND DEEP LEARNING MODELS. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM DETECTS ABNORMAL PLANTS OR LEAVES CONSIDERING THE STAGE OF GROWTH. IT DETECTS THREE CASES: (I) ABNORMAL POTATO PLANTS IN THE EARLY GROWTH STAGE, (II) ABNORMAL POTATO PLANTS IN COMPARISON TO THE SURROUNDING PLANTS, AND (III) ABNORMAL POTATO LEAVES. FOR THE ABNORMAL AND HEALTHY POTATO PLANT CLASSIFICATION, THE ACCURACY WAS ~90%, AND THE AVERAGE PRECISION (AP) FOR DETECTION WAS 78.2%. FURTHERMORE, THE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY OF THE ABNORMAL AND HEALTHY POTATO LEAF CLASSIFICATION WAS 96.7%, AND THE AP FOR DETECTION WAS 90.5%.

THE HYPERSPECTRAL CAMERA CAN CAPTURE LANDSCAPE IMAGES THAT INCLUDE CROPS, WEEDS, AND THE SOIL SURFACE, AND CAN PROVIDE MORE EXTENSIVE INFORMATION THAN CONVENTIONAL RED, GREEN, AND BLUE (RGB) IMAGES. ALTHOUGH RGB IMAGES CONSIST OF RED, GREEN, AND BLUE WAVEBANDS, THE OBTAINED HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGES CONSIST OF 240 WAVEBANDS OF SPECTRAL INFORMATION. HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGING IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE POWERFUL TECHNOLOGY FOR AGRICULTURAL SENSING. IN THE INITIAL STEP OF THIS STUDY, THE IMAGE PIXELS OF THE PLANTS (CROP OR WEEDS) WERE SEGMENTED FROM THE BACKGROUND SOIL SURFACE USING EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE AS THE DISCRIMINANT FUNCTION. IN THE NEXT STEP, THE IMAGE PIXELS OF THE CROP (SUGARBEET) AND WEEDS (FOUR SPECIES) WERE CLASSIFIED USING THE DIFFERENCE IN THE SPECTRAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PLANT SPECIES. IN THIS PROCESS, CLASSIFICATION VARIABLES WERE GENERATED USING WAVELET TRANSFORMATION FOR DATA COMPRESSION, NOISE REDUCTION, AND FEATURE EXTRACTION, AND THEN STEPWISE LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS WAS APPLIED.

FLORA INCOGNITA WAS ALSO DIRECTLY TESTED IN FIELD CONDITIONS IN VARIOUS HABITATS, TAKING IMAGES OF PLANT ORGANS AS GUIDED BY THE APPLICATION (998 OBSERVATIONS, 1703 PHOTOS, 280 SPECIES). IDENTIFICATION ACCURACY WAS COMPARED AMONG SPECIES CHARACTERISTICS: PLANT FAMILY, GROWTH FORMS AND LIFE FORMS, HABITAT TYPE AND REGIONAL FREQUENCY. WE ALSO ANALYSED IMAGE CHARACTERISTICS (PLANT ORGANS, BACKGROUND, NUMBER OF SPECIES IN FOCUS), AND THE NUMBER OF TRAINING IMAGES THAT WERE AVAILABLE FOR PARTICULAR SPECIES TO DEVELOP THE AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION ALGORITHM. FROM DATABASE IMAGES 79.6 % OF SPECIES WERE CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED BY FLORA INCOGNITA; IN THE FIELD CONDITIONS SPECIES IDENTIFICATION ACCURACY REACHED 85.3 %. OVERALL, THE CORRECT GENUS WAS FOUND FOR 89 % AND THE CORRECT PLANT FAMILY FOR 95 % OF THE SPECIES. ACCURACY VARIED AMONG DIFFERENT PLANT FAMILIES, LIFE FORMS AND GROWTH FORMS. RARE AND COMMON SPECIES AND SPECIES FROM DIFFERENT HABITATS WERE IDENTIFIED WITH EQUAL ACCURACY. IMAGES WITH REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS OR WITH ONLY THE TARGET SPECIES IN FOCUS WERE IDENTIFIED WITH GREATER SUCCESS. THE NUMBER OF TRAINING IMAGES PER SPECIES WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE IDENTIFICATION SUCCESS. EVEN THOUGH A HIGH ACCURACY HAS BEEN ALREADY ACHIEVED FOR FLORA INCOGNITA, ALLOWING ITS USAGE FOR RESEARCH AND PRACTICES, OUR RESULTS CAN GUIDE FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS OF THIS APPLICATION AND AUTOMATED PLANT IDENTIFICATION IN GENERAL.

"LIN D;CHENG C";RESEARCH ON FLOWER IMAGE RECOGNITION ALGORITHM;FLOWER RECOGNITION IS ONE OF THE TASK TO DISTINGUISH THE SPECIES OF FLOWERS. SINCE THE SPECIES OF FLOWERS WITH A GREAT OF VARIETY, IT IS A HARD TASK TO DISTINGUISH THE SPECIES BY JUST USING THE MANUAL FEATURES. RECENTLY, WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUE, IT CAN HELP US TO DISCOVERY MUCH MORE FEATURES HIDDEN IN THE IMAGE AND THEN HELP US TO IMPROVE THE PRECIOUS OF RECOGNITION. THUS, MOTIVED BY THE ADVANTAGE MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUE ON FEATURE EXTRACTION AND THE DEPICTION OF HANDCRAFT FEATURES ON IMAGE DETAIL, WE BUILD OUR FLOWER RECOGNITION MODEL BASED ON THE FEATURES EXTRACTED FROM THE FOLLOWING THREE TYPES: FEATURE EXTRACTED BY USING DEEP LEARNING, DUAL-VIEW FEATURES, AND MULTI-MODAL FEATURES.

"LIN H;LIU X;HAN Z;CUI H;DIAN Y";IDENTIFICATION OF TREE SPECIES IN FOREST COMMUNITIES AT DIFFERENT ALTITUDES BASED ON MULTISOURCE AERIAL REMOTE SENSING DATA;THE ACCURATE IDENTIFICATION OF FOREST TREE SPECIES IS IMPORTANT FOR FOREST RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND INVESTIGATION. USING SINGLE REMOTE SENSING DATA FOR TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION CANNOT QUANTIFY BOTH VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS OF TREE SPECIES, SO THE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY IS LIMITED. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE APPLICATION VALUE OF COMBINING AIRBORNE HIGH-RESOLUTION MULTISPECTRAL IMAGERY AND LIDAR DATA TO CLASSIFY TREE SPECIES IN STUDY AREAS OF DIFFERENT ALTITUDES. THREE STUDY AREAS WITH DIFFERENT ALTITUDES IN MUYU TOWN, SHENNONGJIA FOREST AREA WERE SELECTED. BASED ON THE OBJECT-ORIENTED METHOD FOR IMAGE SEGMENTATION, MULTI-SOURCE REMOTE SENSING FEATURE EXTRACTION WAS PERFORMED. THE RECURSIVE FEATURE ELIMINATION ALGORITHM WAS USED TO FILTER OUT THE FEATURE VARIABLES THAT WERE OPTIMAL FOR CLASSIFYING TREE SPECIES IN EACH ALTITUDE STUDY AREA. FOUR MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS, SVM, KNN, RF, AND XGBOOST, WERE COMBINED TO CLASSIFY TREE SPECIES AT EACH ALTITUDE AND EVALUATE THE ACCURACY. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE DIVERSITY OF TREE LAYERS DECREASED WITH THE ALTITUDE IN THE DIFFERENT STUDY AREAS. THE TEXTURE FEATURES AND HEIGHT FEATURES EXTRACTED FROM LIDAR DATA RESPONDED BETTER TO THE FOREST COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN THE DIFFERENT STUDY AREAS. CONIFEROUS SPECIES SHOWED BETTER CLASSIFICATION THAN BROAD-LEAVED SPECIES WITHIN THE SAME STUDY AREAS. THE XGBOOST CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM SHOWED THE HIGHEST ACCURACY OF 87.63% (KAPPA COEFFICIENT OF 0.85), 88.24% (KAPPA COEFFICIENT OF 0.86), AND 84.03% (KAPPA COEFFICIENT OF 0.81) FOR THE THREE ALTITUDE STUDY AREAS, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMBINATION OF MULTI-SOURCE REMOTE SENSING NUMBERS WITH THE FEATURE FILTERING ALGORITHM AND THE XGBOOST ALGORITHM ENABLED ACCURATE FOREST TREE SPECIES CLASSIFICATION.

IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSED A POINT-BASED DEEP NEURAL NETWORK CALLED LAYERNET. FOR LIGHT DETECTION AND RANGING (LIDAR) DATA IN FOREST REGIONS, THE NETWORK CAN DIVIDE MULTIPLE OVERLAPPING LAYERS IN EUCLIDEAN SPACE TO OBTAIN THE LOCAL THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D) STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF THE TREE. THE FEATURES OF ALL LAYERS ARE AGGREGATED, AND THE GLOBAL FEATURE IS OBTAINED BY CONVOLUTION TO CLASSIFY THE TREE SPECIES. TO VALIDATE THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK, MULTIPLE EXPERIMENTS, INCLUDING AIRBORNE AND GROUND-BASED LIDAR DATASETS, ARE CONDUCTED AND COMPARED WITH SEVERAL EXISTING TREE SPECIES CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS.

TO TOLERATE THE SIGNIFICANT INTRACLASS VARIANCES, THE CONVOLUTIONAL RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS (C-RNNS) ARE PROPOSED FOR OBSERVATION-CENTERED PLANT IDENTIFICATION TO MIMIC HUMAN BEHAVIORS. THE C-RNN MODEL IS COMPOSED OF TWO COMPONENTS: THE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) BACKBONE IS USED AS A FEATURE EXTRACTOR FOR IMAGES, AND THE RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK (RNN) UNITS ARE BUILT TO SYNTHESIZE MULTIVIEW FEATURES FROM EACH IMAGE FOR FINAL PREDICTION. EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTS ARE CONDUCTED TO EXPLORE THE BEST COMBINATION OF CNN AND RNN. ALL MODELS ARE TRAINED END-TO-END WITH 1 TO 3 PLANT IMAGES OF THE SAME OBSERVATION BY TRUNCATED BACK PROPAGATION THROUGH TIME. THE EXPERIMENTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE COMBINATION OF MOBILENET AND GATED RECURRENT UNIT (GRU) IS THE BEST TRADE-OFF OF CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY AND COMPUTATIONAL OVERHEAD ON THE FLAVIA DATASET.

"LIU Y;LI Y;ZHAO Y;NA X";IMAGE CLASSIFICATION AND RECOGNITION OF MEDICINAL PLANTS BASED ON CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK;WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTER VISION, PLANT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS HAVE HELPED BOTANISTS RECOGNIZE AND IDENTIFY PLANT SPECIES MORE QUICKLY. WE USUALLY DIFFERENTIATE PLANTS OF DIFFERENT SPECIES BASED ON MORPHOLOGY, TEXTURE, COLOR, AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS. THESE FEATURES CAN EXHIBIT HIGH DEGREES OF SIMILARITY, AND THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SPECIES CAN BE MINOR. THIS PAPER PROPOSES A CLASSIFICATION AND RECOGNITION METHOD FOR MEDICINAL PLANTS BASED ON THE RESNET34 CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK, FOCUSING ON THE IMAGE RECOGNITION OF MEDICINAL GRASSLAND PLANTS. FIRST, WE USE TARGETED AND EFFECTIVE CLASSIFICATIONS FOR SPECIES TASKS BASED ON THE PLANT-NET. THEN, WEAKLY SUPERVISED ATTENTION FUNCTIONS ARE USED TO LEARN TO LOCATE AND RECOGNIZE MORE DISCRIMINATIVE FEATURES AND IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND ACCURACY OF RECOGNITION. MOREOVER, DATA AUGMENTATION METHODS COMBINED WITH LABEL-SMOOTH LOSS FUNCTIONS ARE USED TO IMPROVE THE GENERALIZATION OF MODEL BY INTRODUCING MORE DATA VARIANCES.

"LIM M;CHUAH J";DURIAN TYPES RECOGNITION USING DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES;FRUIT OR PLANT RECOGNITION IS A VERY PRAGMATIC AND SPECIFIC APPLICATION OF DEEP-LEARNING TECHNIQUE. AS COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL METHOD, THE TECHNIQUE REQUIRES A LARGER QUANTITY OF DATA FOR TRAINING WHILE AT THE SAME TIME PROMISES A HIGHER LEVEL OF ACCURACY. AMONG VARIOUS CLASSES OF NEURAL NETWORK, CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) IS ARGUABLY THE MOST COMMONLY USED METHOD IN IMAGE CLASSIFICATION. THE AIM OF THIS RESEARCH WORK IS TO DEVELOP AN EFFECTIVE METHOD TO CLASSIFY THE VARIOUS CULTIVARS OF DURIO ZIBETHINUS (OR COMMONLY KNOWN AS DURIAN) BASED ON THE CROP'S VISUAL FEATURES VIA THE APPLICATION OF CNN TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY AND SPEED OF THE CULTIVARS RECOGNITION. MEANWHILE, A RELIABLE DATABASE CONSISTING OF LABELLED DURIAN CULTIVARS HAS BEEN CREATED. A TOTAL OF 800 IMAGES CONSISTING OF THE BOTTOM VIEW OF 3 CLASSES OF CULTIVARS AND NON-DURIAN IMAGES ARE USED DURING THE TRAINING PROCESS OF THE NEURAL NETWORK. THE RESEARCH WORK STARTS WITH THE PRE-PROCESSING AND CONVERSION OF THE IMAGES THEN FOLLOWED BY ONE-HOT LABELLING OF THE DATA, CONSTRUCTION OF THE NETWORK ARCHITECTURE, TRAINING AND VALIDATION OF THE MODEL THEN LASTLY EXPORTING THE TRAINED MODEL FOR GENERAL APPLICATION. IMPORTANT SYSTEM PARAMETERS AND PREDICTION ACCURACY ARE OBTAINED, INCLUDING THE GRAPHS OF LOSS FUNCTION AND ACCURACY AGAINST THE NUMBER OF EPOCHS, CONFUSION MATRIX, MISS-CLASSIFIED IMAGES, THE EFFECT OF NETWORK ARCHITECTURE ON PREDICTION PERFORMANCE, ETC.

"LV Z;ZHANG Z";RESEARCH ON PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION METHOD BASED ON MULTIFEATURE FUSION IN DIFFERENT PARTITION BLOCKS;AS AN INDISPENSABLE ORGANISM IN NATURE, PLANTS PLAY AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN THE ECOLOGICAL EQUILIBRIUM. ECOLOGICAL PLANT PROTECTION IS ALSO RECEIVING INCREASING ATTENTION. IN TODAY'S DIGITAL ERA, ONE OF THE IMPORTANT RESEARCH TOPICS IS RECOGNIZING PLANTS BY USING IMAGING EQUIPMENT. IN THIS STUDY, WE PROPOSE A MULTI-FEATURE FUSION APPROACH BASED ON THE LOCAL BINARY PATTERN (LBP) FEATURE FOR PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION BY USING THE PARTITION BLOCK STRATEGY. BY COMPARING THE ORIGINAL LBP AND MULTISCALE BLOCK LOCAL BINARY PATTERN (MB-LBP), WE PRESENT AN IMPROVED LBP FEATURE DESCRIPTOR. IT EXTENDS THE RANGE OF FEATURE EXTRACTION, CONSIDERING THE EFFECT THAT THE MULTI-NEIGHBOURHOOD PIXELS HAVE ON THE CENTRAL PIXELS DURING THE LBP ENCODING PROCESS AND THE CENTRAL PIXELS ARE REPRESENTED BY DOUBLE CODING VALUES. THEREFORE, IT CAN EXTRACT MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT PLANT LEAVES. MOREOVER, CONSIDERING THE LEAF BOUNDARY AND SHAPE INFORMATION EXTRACTION AND THE ILLUMINATION VARIATIONS, THE HISTOGRAM OF ORIENTED GRADIENT (HOG) FEATURE AND THE COLOUR FEATURE ARE FUSED WITH THE IMPROVED LBP FEATURE DESCRIPTOR. AFTER DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION BY PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS (PCA), A MIXED FEATURE VECTOR OF PLANT LEAVES IS USED AS INPUT TO AN EXTREME LEARNING MACHINE (ELM) FOR IDENTIFYING PLANT LEAVES IN TWO PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATASETS, THE FLAVIA DATASET AND THE SWEDISH DATASET. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT OUR ALGORITHM OUTPERFORMS THE CONVENTIONAL ALGORITHMS, WITH THE RECOGNITION ACCURACY OF 99.30% ON THE FLAVIA DATASET WHERE 4 Ã— 4 PARTITION BLOCKS ARE USED FOR THE IMPROVED LBP FEATURE AND 2 Ã— 2 PARTITION BLOCKS FOR THE COLOUR FEATURE, 99.52% ON THE SWEDISH DATASET WHERE 4 Ã— 4 PARTITION BLOCKS ARE USED FOR THE IMPROVED LBP FEATURE AND 2 Ã— 2 PARTITION BLOCKS FOR THE COLOUR FEATURE, RESPECTIVELY.

GRAIN DISCOLORATION AND MEDICINAL PLANTS IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION, IN VIETNAM VIA COMBINING THE IDEA OF KNOWLEDGE TRANSFERABILITY AND STATE-OF-THE-ART DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS. GRAIN DISCOLORATION DISEASE OF RICE IS AN EMERGING THREAT TO RICE HARVEST IN VIETNAM AS WELL AS ALL OVER THE WORLD AND IT ACQUIRES SPECIFIC ATTENTION AS IT RESULTS IN QUALITATIVE LOSS OF HARVESTED CROP. MEDICINAL PLANTS ARE AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF INDIGENOUS MEDICAL SYSTEMS. THESE RESOURCES ARE USUALLY REGARDED AS A PART OF CULTURE'S TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE. ACCURATE CLASSIFICATION IS PRELIMINARY TO ANY KIND OF INTERVENTION AND RECOMMENDATION OF SERVICES. HENCE, LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY IN AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION OF THESE PROBLEMS HAS BECOME ESSENTIAL. UNFORTUNATELY, BUILDING AND TRAINING A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL FROM SCRATCH IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE DUE TO THE LACK OF HARDWARE INFRASTRUCTURE AND FINANCE SUPPORT. IT PAINFULLY RESTRICTS THE REQUIREMENTS OF RAPID SOLUTIONS TO DEAL WITH THE DEMAND. FOR THIS PURPOSE, THE AUTHORS HAVE EXPLOITED THE IDEA OF TRANSFER LEARNING WHICH IS THE IMPROVEMENT OF LEARNING IN A NEW PREDICTION TASK THROUGH THE TRANSFERABILITY OF KNOWLEDGE FROM A RELATED PREDICTION TASK THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN LEARNED. BY UTILIZING STATE-OF-THE-ART DEEP NETWORKS RE-TRAINED UPON OUR COLLECTED DATA, OUR EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED COMBINATION PERFORMS PERFECTLY AND ACHIEVES THE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY OF 98:7% AND 98:5% ON OUR COLLECTED DATASETS WITHIN THE ACCEPTABLE TRAINING TIME ON A NORMAL LAPTOP.

THERE ARE MANY SOURCES FROM A PLANT THAT CAN BE USED AS FEATURE ASPECTS FOR AN AI-BASED MODEL, BUT FEATURES RELATED TO PARTS LIKE LEAVES ARE CONSIDERED AS MORE SIGNIFICANT FOR THE TASK, PRIMARILY DUE TO EASY ACCESSIBILITY, THAN OTHER PARTS LIKE FLOWERS, STEMS, ETC. WITH THIS NOTION, WE PROPOSE A PLANT SPECIES RECOGNITION MODEL BASED ON MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES EXTRACTED FROM CORRESPONDING LEAVESâ€™ IMAGES USING THE SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) WITH ADAPTIVE BOOSTING TECHNIQUE. THIS PROPOSED FRAMEWORK INCLUDES THE PRE-PROCESSING, EXTRACTION OF FEATURES AND CLASSIFICATION INTO ONE OF THE SPECIES. VARIOUS MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES LIKE CENTROID, MAJOR AXIS LENGTH, MINOR AXIS LENGTH, SOLIDITY, PERIMETER, AND ORIENTATION ARE EXTRACTED FROM THE DIGITAL IMAGES OF VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF LEAVES. IN ADDITION TO THIS, TRANSFER LEARNING, AS SUGGESTED BY SOME PREVIOUS STUDIES, HAS ALSO BEEN USED IN THE FEATURE EXTRACTION PROCESS. VARIOUS CLASSIFIERS LIKE THE KNN, DECISION TREES, AND MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON (WITH AND WITHOUT ADABOOST) ARE EMPLOYED ON THE OPENSOURCE DATASET, FLAVIA, TO CERTIFY OUR STUDY IN ITS ROBUSTNESS, IN CONTRAST TO OTHER CLASSIFIER FRAMEWORKS.

THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN APPROACH FOR GENERATING ARTIFICIAL IMAGE SAMPLES OF PLANT SEEDLINGS USING GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS (GAN) TO ALLEVIATE FOR THE LACK OF TRAINING DATA FOR DEEP LEARNING SYSTEMS IN THIS DOMAIN. WE SHOW THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO USE GAN TO PRODUCE SAMPLES THAT ARE VISUALLY DISTINCT ACROSS NINE DIFFERENT PLANTS SPECIES AND MAINTAIN A HIGH AMOUNT VARIANCE WITHIN EACH SPECIES. THE GENERATED SAMPLES RESEMBLE THE INTENDED SPECIES WITH AN AVERAGE RECOGNITION ACCURACY OF 58.9Â±9.2%, EVALUATED USING A STATE-OF-THE-ART CLASSIFICATION MODEL. THE OBSERVED ERRORS ARE RELATED TO SAMPLES REPRESENTING SPECIES WHICH ARE RELATIVELY ANONYMOUS AT THE DICOTYLEDONOUS GROWTH STAGE AND TO THE MODEL'S INCAPABILITY TO REPRODUCE SMALL SHAPE DETAILS. THE ARTIFICIAL PLANT SAMPLES ARE ALSO USED FOR PRETRAINING A CLASSIFICATION MODEL, WHICH IS FINETUNED USING REAL DATA. THE PRETRAINED MODEL ACHIEVES 62.0Â±5.3% ACCURACY ON CLASSIFYING REAL PLANT SEEDLINGS PRIOR TO ANY FINETUNING, THUS PROVIDING A STRONG BASIS FOR FURTHER TRAINING.

FOR THIS, WE USE TWO CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) ARCHITECTURES, ALEXNET AND GOOGLENET TRAINED FROM SCRATCH OR USING PRE-TRAINED WEIGHTS. THESE CNN MODELS ARE THEN TRAINED AND TESTED ON BOTH ORIGINAL AND DATA-AUGMENTED IMAGE DATASETS FOR THREE PLANT CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS: FOLIO, AGRILPLANT, AND THE SWEDISH LEAF DATASET. WE EVALUATE THE UTILITY OF SIX INDIVIDUAL DA TECHNIQUES (ROTATION, BLUR, CONTRAST, SCALING, ILLUMINATION, AND PROJECTIVE TRANSFORMATION) AND SEVERAL COMBINATIONS OF THESE TECHNIQUES, RESULTING IN A TOTAL OF 12 DATA-AUGMENTATION METHODS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE CNN METHODS WITH PARTICULAR DATA-AUGMENTED DATASETS YIELD THE HIGHEST ACCURACIES, WHICH ALSO SURPASS PREVIOUS RESULTS ON THE THREE DATASETS.

"MANOJ K P;SURYA C;GOPI V";IDENTIFICATION OF AYURVEDIC MEDICINAL PLANTS BY IMAGE PROCESSING OF LEAF SAMPLES;IDENTIFICATION OF THE CORRECT MEDICINAL PLANTS THAT GOES IN TO THE PREPARATION OF A MEDICINE IS VERY IMPORTANT IN AYURVEDIC MEDICINAL INDUSTRY. THE MAIN FEATURES REQUIRED TO IDENTIFY A MEDICINAL PLANT IS ITS LEAF SHAPE, COLOUR AND TEXTURE. COLOUR AND TEXTURE FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE LEAF CONTAIN DETERMINISTIC PARAMETERS TO IDENTIFY THE SPECIES. THIS PAPER EXPLORES FEATURE VECTORS FROM BOTH THE FRONT AND BACK SIDE OF A GREEN LEAF ALONG WITH MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES TO ARRIVE AT A UNIQUE OPTIMUM COMBINATION OF FEATURES THAT MAXIMIZES THE IDENTIFICATION RATE. A DATABASE OF MEDICINAL PLANT LEAVES IS CREATED FROM SCANNED IMAGES OF FRONT AND BACK SIDE OF LEAVES OF COMMONLY USED AYURVEDIC MEDICINAL PLANTS. THE LEAVES ARE CLASSIFIED BASED ON THE UNIQUE FEATURE COMBINATION. IDENTIFICATION RATES UP TO 99% HAVE BEEN OBTAINED WHEN TESTED OVER A WIDE SPECTRUM OF CLASSIFIERS. THE ABOVE WORK HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO INCLUDE IDENTIFICATION BY DRY LEAVES AND A COMBINATION OF FEATURE VECTORS IS OBTAINED, USING WHICH, IDENTIFICATION RATES EXCEEDING 94% HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED.

A DEVELOPING APPLICATION OF DEEP LEARNING IS THE AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC INVASIVE PLANTS. CLASSIFICATION OF SUBMERSED AQUATIC VEGETATION (SAV) PRESENTS A UNIQUE CHALLENGE, NAMELY, THE LACK OF A SINGLE SOURCE OF SENSOR DATA THAT CAN PRODUCE ROBUST, INTERPRETABLE IMAGES ACROSS A VARIABLE RANGE OF DEPTH, TURBIDITY, AND LIGHTING CONDITIONS. THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MULTIâ€SENSOR (RGB AND HYDROACOUSTIC) CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM FOR SAV THAT IS ROBUST TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND COMBINES THE STRENGTHS OF EACH SENSING MODALITY. THE DETECTION OF INVASIVE HYDRILLA VERTICILLATA (HYDRILLA) IS THE PRIMARY GOAL. OVER 5000 AERIAL RGB AND HYDROACOUSTIC IMAGES WERE GENERATED FROM TWO FLORIDA LAKES VIA AN UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE AND BOATâ€MOUNTED SONAR UNIT, AND TAGGED FOR NEURAL NETWORK TRAINING AND EVALUATION. CLASSES INCLUDED â€œHYDR,â€ CONTAINING HYDRILLA; â€œNONEâ€, LACKING SAV, AND â€œOTHER,â€ CONTAINING SAV OTHER THAN HYDRILLA. USING A TRANSFER LEARNING APPROACH, DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS WITH THE RESNET ARCHITECTURE WERE INDIVIDUALLY TRAINED ON THE RGB AND HYDROACOUSTIC DATASETS. MULTIPLE DATA FUSION METHODOLOGIES WERE EVALUATED TO ENSEMBLE THE OUTPUTS OF THESE NEURAL NETWORKS FOR OPTIMAL CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY. A METHOD INCORPORATING LOGIC AND A MONTE CARLO DROPOUT APPROACH YIELDED THE BEST OVERALL CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY (84%), WITH RECALL AND PRECISION OF 84.5% AND 77.5%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE HYDRILLA CLASS. THE TRAINING AND ENSEMBLING APPROACHES WERE REPEATED FOR A DENSENET MODEL WITH IDENTICAL TRAINING AND TESTING DATASETS. THE OVERALL CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY WAS SIMILAR BETWEEN THE RESNET AND DENSENET MODELS WHEN AVERAGED ACROSS ALL APPROACHES (1.9% HIGHER ACCURACY FOR THE RESNET VS. THE DENSENET).

"MARY S P;THOMAS P";CLASSIFICATION OF PLANT SPECIES WITH COMPOUND AND SIMPLE LEAVES USING CNN FUSION NETWORKS;AN AUTOMATIC PLANT SPECIES IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM COULD HELP TO IDENTIFY PLANT SPECIES VERY EASILY. DEEP LEARNING IS AN AI FUNCTION WHICH WORKS LIKE THE HUMAN BRAIN, WITH ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS. IN NEURAL NETWORKS, NEURON NODES ARE CONNECTED LIKE A WEB AND USED TO EXTRACT HIGHER-LEVEL FEATURES FROM INPUT. CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN), DEEP BELIEF NETWORK (DBF) AND RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK (RNN) ETC. ARE DEEP LEARNING NETWORKS AND CAN EXTRACT MORE DETAILED INFORMATION COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES [1, 10]. CNN IS A VERY GOOD CHOICE FOR IMAGE PROCESSING, AND IT CAN WORK WITH LARGE DATASETS EFFICIENTLY. IN OUR PROJECT VGG16 CNN IS USED TO EXTRACT THE FEATURES FROM LEAF IMAGES OF A SIMPLE AND COMPOUND LEAF. FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF PLANT SPECIES WITH SIMPLE AND COMPOUND LEAVES WITH REAL COMPLEX BACKGROUND IMAGES, THIS PAPER PROPOSES A FUSION CNN MODEL USING ORIGINAL WHOLE LEAF IMAGES AND PATCH IMAGES. A TRANSFER LEARNED VGG16 CNN WAS USED FOR FEATURE EXTRACTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF REAL COMPLEX BACKGROUND IMAGES [1]. FEATURE EXTRACTION AND CLASSIFICATION ARE DONE WITH ORIGINAL (MODEL1) AND PATCH (MODEL2) IMAGES SEPARATELY WITH VGG16 CNN MODELS. THE FEATURE MAPS FROM INTERMEDIATE LEVELS OF MODEL1 AND MODEL2 ARE TAKEN, THEN CONCATENATED AND CLASSIFIED USING SVM AND KNN. THE CNN-SVM MODEL HAS THE BEST PERFORMANCE OVER MODEL1, MODEL2 AND CNN-KNN MODEL. THE PROPOSED FUSION MODEL SHOWS THE EFFICIENCY OF 98.6% ACCURACY IN MODEL EVALUATION AND 90% ACCURACY IN PLANT IDENTIFICATION USING COMPLEX BACKGROUND LEAF IMAGES.

IN ORDER TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WE CAN USE THE CURRENT TECHNOLOGY TO GIVE A TOOL WHICH WILL HELP THE COMMON PEOPLE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE MEDICINAL PLANTS. FOR DOING THIS WE CAN USE MANY MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES FOR CLASSIFYING THE MEDICINAL PLANTS WITH MORE ACCURACY. DIFFERENT KIND OF MEDICINAL PLANT SPECIES ARE AVAILABLE ON THE PLANET EARTH BUT CLASSIFICATION OF THE PARTICULAR MEDICINAL PLANT IS VERY DIFFICULT WITHOUT KNOWING ABOUT THE PLANTS FIRST. THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEDICINAL PLANTS IS COLLECTED BY THE SCIENTISTS AND URBAN PEOPLE. GENERALLY THIS KIND OF KNOWLEDGE IS PASSED THROUGH GENERATION TO GENERATION AND SOMETIMES THERE MIGHT BE SOME CHANGES IN THE INFORMATION AND ITS CONTENTS.

"MUNISAMI T;RAMSURN M;KISHNAH S;PUDARUTH S";PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION USING SHAPE FEATURES AND COLOUR HISTOGRAM WITH KNEAREST NEIGHBOUR CLASSIFIERS;AUTOMATED SYSTEMS FOR PLANT RECOGNITION CAN BE USED TO CLASSIFY PLANTS INTO APPROPRIATE TAXONOMIES. SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE USEFUL FOR BOTANISTS, INDUSTRIALISTS, FOOD ENGINEERS AND PHYSICIANS. IN THIS WORK, A RECOGNITION SYSTEM CAPABLE OF IDENTIFYING PLANTS BY USING THE IMAGES OF THEIR LEAVES HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. A MOBILE APPLICATION WAS ALSO DEVELOPED TO ALLOW A USER TO TAKE PICTURES OF LEAVES AND UPLOAD THEM TO A SERVER. THE SERVER RUNS PRE-PROCESSING AND FEATURE EXTRACTION TECHNIQUES ON THE IMAGE BEFORE A PATTERN MATCHER COMPARES THE INFORMATION FROM THIS IMAGE WITH THE ONES IN THE DATABASE IN ORDER TO GET POTENTIAL MATCHES. THE DIFFERENT FEATURES THAT ARE EXTRACTED ARE THE LENGTH AND WIDTH OF THE LEAF, THE AREA OF THE LEAF, THE PERIMETER OF THE LEAF, THE HULL AREA, THE HULL PERIMETER, A DISTANCE MAP ALONG THE VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL AXES, A COLOUR HISTOGRAM AND A CENTROID-BASED RADIAL DISTANCE MAP. A K-NEAREST NEIGHBOUR CLASSIFIER WAS IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED ON 640 LEAVES BELONGING TO 32 DIFFERENT SPECIES OF PLANTS. AN ACCURACY OF 83.5% WAS OBTAINED. THE SYSTEM WAS FURTHER ENHANCED BY USING INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM A COLOUR HISTOGRAM WHICH INCREASED THE RECOGNITION ACCURACY TO 87.3%. FURTHERMORE, OUR SYSTEM IS SIMPLE TO USE, FAST AND HIGHLY SCALABLE.

"QU Y;CHEN Y;CHEN W";CODESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF IMAGE RECOGNITION BASED ON ARM AND FPGA;WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTERNET OF THINGS, THE IMAGE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS WIDELY REQUIRED IN MANY FIELDS. IT HAS VERY HIGH REQUIREMENT IN REAL-TIME, BUT USUALLY IT HAS HIGH COMPLEXITY AND LARGE DATA. SO THE REAL-TIME, WHICH IMPROVED BY HARDWARE ACCELERATION, IS THE KEY OF IMAGE RECOGNITION SYSTEM. TRADITIONAL PROCESSORS HAVE THE DISADVANTAGES OF LOW FLEXIBILITY AND CONFIGURABILITY FOR PROTOTYPE OF EMBEDDED SYSTEM. THE FAMILY OF XILINX ZYNQ7000 PROCESSORS INTEGRATE DUAL-CORE ARM CORTEXT-A9 AND LOW-POWER FPGA. IT CAN IMPROVE THE OPERATING EFFICIENCY AND DYNAMICAL CONFIGURABILITY OF DEVELOPING IMAGE APPLICATIONS. IT ALSO CAN REDUCE THE POWER CONSUMPTION OF IMAGE PROCESSING. IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT AN ARM AND FPGA CO-DESIGN ARCHITECTURE OF IMAGE RECOGNITION SYSTEM BASED ON ZYNQ7000 PROCESSOR. THEN WE VALIDATE THIS ARCHITECTURE BY THE LEAF RECOGNITION SYSTEM. THIS ARCHITECTURE IS BASED ON MODULE DESIGNED AT SYSTEM-LEVEL AND MODELED AT ALGORITHM-LEVEL. AFTER DETERMINING THE ALGORITHM OPTION, WE PARTITE THE ARM AND FPGA OF MODULES DEPENDING ON ALGORITHM SIMULATION, AND THEN IMPLEMENT THEM SEPARATELY. FINALLY, ARM AND FPGA MODULES ARE INTERCONNECTED BY INTERFACE OR DRIVER. WHEN THE JOINT DEBUGGING IS COMPLETED, PROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT OF THE EMBEDDED APPLICATION IS FINISHED. AS THE EXPERIMENT SHOWN, FPGA AND ARM CO-DESIGN IS 1.84 TIMES FASTER THAN THE PURE ARM.

TO ADDRESS THIS NEED, WE HAVE DEVELOPED AN APPROACH BASED ON A DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) TO CLASSIFY FOREST TREE SPECIES AT THE INDIVIDUAL TREE-LEVEL THAT USES HIGH-RESOLUTION RGB IMAGES ACQUIRED FROM A CONSUMER-GRADE CAMERA MOUNTED ON A UAV PLATFORM. THIS WORK EXPLORES THE ABILITY OF THE DENSE CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORK (DENSENET) TO CLASSIFY COMMONLY AVAILABLE ECONOMIC CONIFEROUS TREE SPECIES IN EASTERN CANADA. THE NETWORK WAS TRAINED USING MULTITEMPORAL IMAGES CAPTURED UNDER VARYING ACQUISITION PARAMETERS TO INCLUDE SEASONAL, TEMPORAL, ILLUMINATION, AND ANGULAR VARIABILITY. VALIDATION OF THIS MODEL USING DISTINCT IMAGES OVER A MIXED-WOOD FOREST IN ONTARIO, CANADA, SHOWED OVER 84% CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY IN DISTINGUISHING FIVE PREDOMINANT SPECIES OF CONIFEROUS TREES.

"NEETHU S;BABY S L";WOOD SPECIES RECOGNITION USING MACHINE LEARNING;ALTHOUGH A COMPUTER VISION-BASED AUTOMATED WOOD SPECIES DETECTION SYSTEM IS NOT EXTENSIVELY EMPLOYED TODAY, IT IS IN HIGH DEMAND IN A RANGE OF INDUSTRIES. BECAUSE EACH SPECIES OF WOOD HAS DISTINCT FEATURES AND TRAITS THAT DETERMINE HOW IT IS USED AND IMPLEMENTED. HUMAN EXPERTS HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN USED NEARLY ENTIRELY IN THE IDENTIFYING PROCESS, WHICH IS BASED ON A VARIETY OF FEATURES OF WOOD, SUCH AS TEXTURE, STRUCTURE, AND COLOUR. EVEN COMPETENT SCIENTISTS HAVE DIFFICULTIES DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN DIFFERENT SPECIES OF WOOD FOUND IN NATURE. THE MOST DIFFICULT ASPECT OF WOOD RECOGNITION IS THAT SOME WOOD SPECIES HAVE A TEXTURE THAT IS IDENTICAL TO THAT OF OTHERS, HENCE FEATURE EXTRACTION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP IN THE PROCESS. SO IN THIS WORK, TWO STATISTICAL FEATURE EXTRACTION TECHNIQUES ARE USED 1) LOCAL BINARY PATTERN (LBP) 2) GRAY LEVEL CO-OCCURRENCE MATRIX (GLCM). FEATURES EXTRACTED FROM BOTH METHODS ARE COMBINED TO SEE WHETHER THEY INCREASE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY OR NOT. MULTI-SVM IS USED FOR CLASSIFICATION.

PLANT WEIGHT IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BIOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES USED TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMUM TIME FOR HARVESTING. CONVENTIONAL PLANT WEIGHT MEASUREMENTS ARE DESTRUCTIVE AND LABORIOUS. AN ON-THE-GO IMAGE PROCESSING SYSTEM CONSISTING OF IMAGE ACQUISITION AND WEIGHT ESTIMATION WAS DEVELOPED TO GENERATE A FRESH WEIGHT MAP OF PLANTS GROWN IN HYDROPONIC SOLUTIONS. KEY TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED IN THIS STUDY ARE REAL-TIME IMAGE PROCESSING AND SPATIAL MAPPING METHODS THAT ESTIMATE THE FRESH WEIGHTS OF INDIVIDUAL LETTUCES. IMAGES WERE AUTOMATICALLY CAPTURED WITH A LOW COST WEB CAMERA AND PROCESSED USING A MYRIO-BASED EMBEDDED CONTROLLER. THE CAMERA AND EMBEDDED SYSTEM MOVED ALONG AN XY AXIS FRAME ABOVE A PLANT GROWING BED (0.94 X 1.8 M) USING TWO STEPPING MOTORS AND LINEAR ACTUATORS. THE IMAGE PREPROCESSING ALGORITHM CONSISTED OF TWO MAIN SUBROUTINES, I.E., IMAGE SEGMENTATION AND TARGET PLANT RECOGNITION. FOR THE IMAGE SEGMENTATION, THE S CHANNEL OF THE HSV COLOR SPACE AND OTSU'S THRESHOLD WERE USED TO SEPARATE THE PLANTS FROM THE BACKGROUND. THE TARGET PLANT WAS IDENTIFIED BASED ON LOCATION INFORMATION OF THE GROWING BED HOLES IN CAPTURED IMAGES. THE PLANT WEIGHT WAS ESTIMATED USING CALIBRATION EQUATIONS PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED THAT RELATE THE PIXEL NUMBERS OF LETTUCE IMAGES TO THEIR ACTUAL FRESH WEIGHTS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE USE OF A TWO-POINT NORMALIZATION METHOD. THE ACCURACY OF THE FRESH WEIGHT DETERMINED BY THE DEVELOPED EMBEDDED SYSTEM WAS CONFIRMED BY A HIGHLY LINEAR RELATIONSHIP WITH A SLOPE NEAR 1.0 AND A COEFFICIENT OF DETERMINATION (R2) OF 0.95 WITH A PROCESSING TIME OF WITHIN 4 S. IN ADDITION, IT WAS POSSIBLE TO GENERATE A SPATIAL MAP OF THE FRESH WEIGHTS OF LETTUCES GROWN IN A CULTIVATION BED, WHICH COULD BE USED TO ESTIMATE THEIR YIELDS PRIOR TO HARVESTING.

IN ORDER TO BE ACTUALLY CONSUMED, UNCONVENTIONAL FOOD PLANTS SHOULD BE KNOWN AND DISSEMINATED. HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHES DEALING WITH PLANTS IDENTIFICATION IN THE LITERATURE, NONE OF THEM ADDRESSES THE AUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION OF THESE SPECIES. THIS WORK PRESENTS A STUDY FOCUSED ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF UNCONVENTIONAL FOOD PLANTS BY MEANS OF TWO DIFFERENT STRATEGIES: 1) THE CLASSICAL COMBINATION OF DIGITAL IMAGE PROCESSING-BASED FEATURE GENERATION AND MACHINE LEARNING; AND 2) CNN (CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK) FOR FEATURE REPRESENTATION AND CLASSIFICATION. TO DO SO, THE AUTHORS GENERATED A DATABASE OF SELECTED SPECIES. THE PAPER ALSO DETAILS THE PROCESS OF DATABASE COLLECTING, ITS CONSTITUTION AND REPRESENTATIVENESS, AS WELL AS THE EXPERIMENTS PERFORMED ON COMPARING THE TWO INVESTIGATED STRATEGIES. IN THE FIRST STRATEGY, WE STUDIED 17 FEATURES, INCLUDING SHAPE AND TEXTURE FEATURES AND EMPLOYED RANDOM FOREST AS CLASSIFIER. SINCE WE EXTRACTED THE FEATURES FROM SEGMENTED LEAVES, THE PAPER ALSO DETAILS THE SEGMENTATION PROCESS. FINALLY, THE SECOND STRATEGY APPLIES A CNN PRE-TRAINED ON IMAGENET.

PREVIOUSLY, PLANT GROWERS USED TO RELY ON OBSERVATION AND EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN PLANT VARIETIES. HOWEVER, SOME PLANTS, SUCH AS LEAVES AND BRANCHES, HAVE NEARLY IDENTICAL TRAITS, MAKING IDENTIFICATION DIFFICULT. HENCE, THERE IS A NEED FOR A SYSTEM CAPABLE OF RESOLVING THIS ISSUE. THUS, THE FOCUS OF THIS RESEARCH IS ON CLASSIFYING PLANT LEAVES USING A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) TECHNIQUE. CORIANDER AND PARSLEY WERE CHOSEN AS TEST SUBJECTS FOR THIS STUDY BECAUSE THEIR LEAVES HAVE COMPARABLE STRUCTURES. THE INPUT IMAGE WAS SUBJECTED TO A NUMBER OF FILTER LAYERS USING CNN. A TOTAL OF 100 CORIANDER AND PARSLEY LEAF PHOTOS ARE COLLECTED FOR THIS RESEARCH. THESE PHOTOS WERE FILTERED USING KERNELS. THESE KERNELS HAVE A SET SIZE AND EXTRACT FEATURES FROM THE INPUT PHOTOS TO CREATE A FEATURE MAP. THESE EXTRACTED FEATURES WILL THEN BE USED TO CLASSIFY PLANT LEAVES ACCORDING TO ITS CLASSES TYPE. WITH THE USE OF THE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE (GUI), THE END USER WILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE TYPE OF LEAF.

PLANT IDENTIFICATION IS IMPORTANT FOR MEDICAL AS WELL AS EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES BUT MAINTAINING AN EXHAUSTIVE DIGITAL DATABASE IS A CHALLENGING TASK DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF LARGE NUMBER OF PLANT SPECIES. THIS PAPER PROPOSES A SYSTEM FOR BUILDING A DIGITAL DATABASE OF LOCAL FLORA AND RECOGNIZING DIFFERENT PLANTS USING THEIR LEAF IMAGES. THE SYSTEM PROPOSED IN THIS PAPER INVOLVES FOUR STEPS: 1) IMAGE ACQUISITION, 2) IMAGE PREPROCESSING, 3) FEATURE EXTRACTION, AND 4) CLASSIFICATION. IMAGES ARE ACQUIRED USING COMMONLY AVAILABLE GENERAL PURPOSE DESKTOP SCANNER WITH WHITE PAPER AS A BACKGROUND. IN THE IMAGE-PREPROCESSING MODULE, THE SYSTEM APPLIES SEVERAL IMAGE-PROCESSING TECHNIQUES TO PREPARE A LEAF IMAGE FOR THE FEATURE EXTRACTION PROCESS. THEN TWELVE LEAF-SHAPE BASED FEATURES ARE ESTIMATED AND IBI CLASSIFIER IS USED TO CLASSIFY THE PLANT SPECIES. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM WAS USED TO BUILD A DATASET OF LOCAL FLORA OF UTTARAKHAND REGION, CONSISTING OF 1684 IMAGES OF THIRTY-TWO DIFFERENT PLANT SPECIES.

WEEDS COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH CROPS FOR MOISTURE, NUTRIENTS, AND SUNLIGHT. THEY THEREFORE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON CROP YIELD IF NOT SUFFICIENTLY CONTROLLED. WEED DETECTION AND MAPPING IS AN ESSENTIAL STEP IN WEED CONTROL. MANY EXISTING RESEARCH STUDIES RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF REMOTE SENSING SYSTEMS AND MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS IN WEED MANAGEMENT. DEEP LEARNING APPROACHES HAVE SHOWN GOOD PERFORMANCE IN MANY AGRICULTURE-RELATED REMOTE SENSING TASKS, SUCH AS PLANT CLASSIFICATION, DISEASE DETECTION, ETC. HOWEVER, DESPITE THE SUCCESS OF THESE APPROACHES, THEY STILL FACE MANY CHALLENGES SUCH AS HIGH COMPUTATION COST, THE NEED OF LARGE LABELLED DATASETS, INTRA-CLASS DISCRIMINATION (IN GROWING PHASE WEEDS AND CROPS SHARE MANY ATTRIBUTES SIMILARITY AS COLOR, TEXTURE, AND SHAPE), ETC. THIS PAPER AIMS TO SHOW THAT THE ATTENTION-BASED DEEP NETWORK IS A PROMISING APPROACH TO ADDRESS THE FOREMENTIONED PROBLEMS, IN THE CONTEXT OF WEEDS AND CROPS RECOGNITION WITH DRONE SYSTEM. THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE VISUAL TRANSFORMERS (VIT) AND APPLY THEM TO PLANT CLASSIFICATION IN UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES (UAV) IMAGES. DATA WERE COLLECTED USING A HIGH-RESOLUTION CAMERA MOUNTED ON A UAV, WHICH WAS DEPLOYED IN BEET, PARSLEY AND SPINACH FIELDS. THE ACQUIRED DATA WERE AUGMENTED TO BUILD LARGER DATASET, SINCE VIT REQUIRES LARGE SAMPLE SETS FOR BETTER PERFORMANCE, WE ALSO ADOPTED THE TRANSFER LEARNING STRATEGY. EXPERIMENTS WERE SET OUT TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF TRAINING AND VALIDATION DATASET SIZE, AS WELL AS THE EFFECT OF INCREASING THE TEST SET WHILE REDUCING THE TRAINING SET. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT WITH A SMALL LABELED TRAINING DATASET, THE VIT MODELS OUTPERFORM STATE-OF-THE-ART MODELS SUCH AS EFFICIENTNET AND RESNET.

ACCURATE AND EARLY PLANT STRESS DETECTION IS IMPERATIVE IN ENABLING APPROPRIATE AND TIMELY INTERVENTION. ONE OF THE MAJOR LIMITATIONS OF PRIOR WORK IN CHIF-BASED PLANT CLASSIFICATION IS THAT, IN GENERAL, ONLY A FEW KEY INFLECTION POINTS OF A LOCALIZED SELECTION OF A CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE SIGNAL ARE USED TO CALCULATE SINGLE INDEX VALUES FOR CLASSIFICATION. THESE VALUES YIELD LIMITED INSIGHT INTO STRESS LEVEL AND ESPECIALLY INTO STRESSOR TYPE. IN THIS PAPER, WE INTRODUCE AND PRESENT A NEW METHOD FOR PLANT STRESS CLASSIFICATION THAT USES SUPERVISED LEARNING, VIA HIDDEN MARKOV MODELS (HMMS), TO BUILD ACCURATE CLASS PROFILES USING GLOBAL (VERSUS LOCAL) CHLF TIME-VARYING SIGNAL DATA ACQUIRED VIA VIDEO IMAGING.

"PRIYA C;BALASARAVANAN T;THANAMANI A";AN EFFICIENT LEAF RECOGNITION ALGORITHM FOR PLANT CLASSIFICATION USING SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE;RECOGNITION OF PLANTS HAS BECOME AN ACTIVE AREA OF RESEARCH AS MOST OF THE PLANT SPECIES ARE AT THE RISK OF EXTINCTION. THIS PAPER USES AN EFFICIENT MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR THE CLASSIFICATION PURPOSE. THIS PROPOSED APPROACH CONSISTS OF THREE PHASES SUCH AS PREPROCESSING, FEATURE EXTRACTION AND CLASSIFICATION. THE PREPROCESSING PHASE INVOLVES A TYPICAL IMAGE PROCESSING STEPS SUCH AS TRANSFORMING TO GRAY SCALE AND BOUNDARY ENHANCEMENT. THE FEATURE EXTRACTION PHASE DERIVES THE COMMON DMF FROM FIVE FUNDAMENTAL FEATURES. THE MAIN CONTRIBUTION OF THIS APPROACH IS THE SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) CLASSIFICATION FOR EFFICIENT LEAF RECOGNITION. 12 LEAF FEATURES WHICH ARE EXTRACTED AND ORTHOGONALIZED INTO 5 PRINCIPAL VARIABLES ARE GIVEN AS INPUT VECTOR TO THE SVM. CLASSIFIER TESTED WITH FLAVIA DATASET AND A REAL DATASET AND COMPARED WITH K-NN APPROACH, THE PROPOSED APPROACH PRODUCES VERY HIGH ACCURACY AND TAKES VERY LESS EXECUTION TIME.

"PUSHPANATHAN K;HANAFI M;MASOHOR S;ILAHI W";MYLPHERB1 A DATASET OF MALAYSIAN LOCAL PERENNIAL HERBS FOR THE STUDY OF PLANT IMAGES CLASSIFICATION UNDER UNCONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT;RESEARCH IN THE MEDICINAL PLANTSâ€™ RECOGNITION FIELD HAS RECEIVED GREAT ATTENTION DUE TO THE NEED OF PRODUCING A RELIABLE AND ACCURATE SYSTEM THAT CAN RECOGNISE MEDICINAL PLANTS UNDER VARIOUS IMAGING CONDITIONS. NEVERTHELESS, THE STANDARD MEDICINAL PLANT DATASETS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE FOR RESEARCH ARE VERY LIMITED. THIS PAPER PROPOSES A DATASET CONSISTING OF 34200 IMAGES OF TWELVE DIFFERENT HIGH MEDICINAL VALUE LOCAL PERENNIAL HERBS IN MALAYSIA. THE IMAGES WERE CAPTURED UNDER VARIOUS IMAGING CONDITIONS, SUCH AS DIFFERENT SCALES, ILLUMINATIONS, AND ANGLES. IT WILL ENABLE LARGER INTERCLASS AND INTRACLASS VARIABILITY, CREATING ABUNDANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR NEW FINDINGS IN LEAF CLASSIFICATION. THE COMPLEXITY OF THE DATASET IS INVESTIGATED THROUGH AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION USING SEVERAL HIGH-PERFORMANCE DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS. THE EXPERIMENT RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE DATASET CREATES MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADVANCED CLASSIFICATION RESEARCH DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE IMAGES.

SHAO Y;SUPERVISED GLOBALLOCALITY PRESERVING PROJECTION FOR PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION;PLANT LEAF-BASED SPECIES RECOGNITION IS STILL A CHALLENGE DUE TO THE LARGE INTRA-CLASS DIFFERENCES AND THE INTER-CLASS SIMILARITY OF NATURE PLANT LEAVES. A NEW MANIFOLD LEARNING METHOD NAMELY SUPERVISED GLOBAL-LOCALITY PRESERVING PROJECTION (SGLP) IS PROPOSED FOR PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION, INCLUDING THREE STAGES. FIRST, CONSTRUCT THE LOCAL WEIGHTED INTER-CLASS AND INTRA-CLASS SCATTER MATRICES BY LOCAL INFORMATION AND CLASS INFORMATION OF THE TRAINING SAMPLES, AND THEN CONSTRUCT A GLOBAL WEIGHTED INTER-SCATTER MATRIX, FINALLY DESIGN A MULTI-OBJECTION OPTIMAL SOLUTION TO ENHANCE THE COMPACTNESS OF THE INTRA-CLASS POINTS AND INTER-CLASS-MANIFOLD SEPARABILITY. COMPARED WITH THE CLASSICAL MANIFOLD-BASED PLANT RECOGNITION METHODS, GLOBAL WEIGHTED INTER-SCATTER MATRIX IS CONSTRUCTED TO ENLARGE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN DIFFERENT CLASSES OF THE DATA AND THEN EFFECTIVELY REVEAL THE INTRINSIC MANIFOLD STRUCTURE FOR CLASSIFICATION. EXPERIMENTS ON THE ICL AND SWEDISH LEAF DATASETS VALIDATE THAT THE PROPOSED SGLP ALGORITHM OBTAINS HIGHER CLASSIFICATION RESULTS THAN OTHER STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS.

TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM THAT CURRENT PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION ALGORITHMS HAVE DIFFICULTY IN RECOGNIZING FINE-GRAINED LEAF CLASSIFICATION BETWEEN CLASSES, THIS PAPER PROPOSES A DMSNET (DEEP MULTI-SCALE NETWORK) MODEL, A PLANT LEAF CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM BASED ON MULTI-SCALE FEATURE EXTRACTION. IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE EXTRACTION ABILITY OF DIFFERENT FINE-GRAINED FEATURES OF THE MODEL, THE MODEL IS IMPROVED ON THE BASIS OF MULTI-SCALE BACKBONE ARCHITECTURE MODEL. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE BETTER PLANT LEAF CLASSIFICATION, A VISUAL ATTENTION MECHANISM MODULE TO DMSNET IS ADDED AND ADMSNET (ATTENTION-BASED DEEP MULTI-SCALE NETWORK), WHICH MAKES THE MODEL FOCUS MORE ON THE PLANT LEAF ITSELF, IS PROPOSED, ESSENTIAL FEATURES ARE ENHANCED, AND USELESS FEATURES ARE SUPPRESSED. EXPERIMENTS ON REAL DATASETS SHOW THAT THE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY OF THE DMSNET MODEL REACHES 96.43%. IN COMPARISON, THE ACCURACY OF ADMSNET WITH THE ADDITION OF THE ATTENTION MODULE REACHES 97.39%, AND THE COMPARISON EXPERIMENTS WITH RESNET-50, RESNEXT, RES2NET-50 AND RES2NET-101 MODELS ON THE SAME DATASET SHOW THAT DMSNET IMPROVED THE ACCURACY BY 4.6%, 18.57%, 3.72% AND 3.84%, RESPECTIVELY.

"PLATA D;RAMOS-POLLÃN R;GONZÃLEZ F";EFFECTIVE TRAINING OF CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS WITH SMALL SPECIALIZED DATASETS;THIS WORK PROPOSES A SUPERVISED LAYER-WISE STRATEGY TO TRAIN DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (DCNS) PARTICULARLY SUITED FOR SMALL, SPECIALIZED IMAGE DATASETS. DCNS ARE INCREASINGLY BEING USED WITH CONSIDERABLE SUCCESS IN IMAGE CLASSIFICATION TASKS AND TRAINED OVER LARGE DATASETS (WITH MORE THAN 1M IMAGES AND 10 K CLASSES). PRE-TRAINED SUCCESSFUL DCNS CAN THEN BE USED FOR NEW SMALLER DATASETS (10 K TO 100 K IMAGES) THROUGH A TRANSFER LEARNING PROCESS WHICH CANNOT GUARANTEE COMPETITIVE A-PRIORI PERFORMANCE IF THE NEW DATA IS OF DIFFERENT OR SPECIALIZED NATURE (MEDICAL IMAGING, PLANT RECOGNITION, ETC.). WE THEREFORE SEEK OUT TO FIND COMPETITIVE TECHNIQUES TO TRAIN DCNS FOR SUCH SMALL DATASETS, AND HEREBY DESCRIBE A SUPERVISED GREEDY LAYER-WISE METHOD ANALOGOUS TO THAT USED IN UNSUPERVISED DEEP NETWORKS. OUR METHOD CONSISTENTLY OUTPERFORMS THE TRADITIONAL METHODS THAT TRAIN A FULL DCN ARCHITECTURE IN A SINGLE STAGE, YIELDING AN AVERAGE OF OVER 20 INCREASE IN CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE ACROSS ALL DCN ARCHITECTURES AND DATASETS USED IN THIS WORK. FURTHERMORE, WE OBTAIN MORE INTERPRETABLE AND CLEANER VISUAL FEATURES. OUR METHOD IS BETTER SUITED FOR SMALL, SPECIALIZED DATASETS SINCE WE REQUIRE A TRAINING CYCLE FOR EACH DCN LAYER AND THIS INCREASES ITS COMPUTING TIME ALMOST LINEARLY WITH THE NUMBER OF LAYERS. NEVERTHELESS, IT STILL REMAINS AS A FRACTION OF THE COMPUTING TIME REQUIRED TO GENERATE PRE-TRAINED MODELS WITH LARGE GENERIC DATASETS, AND POSES NO ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS ON HARDWARE. THIS CONSTITUTES A SOLID ALTERNATIVE FOR TRAINING DCNS WHEN TRANSFER LEARNING IS NOT POSSIBLE AND, FURTHERMORE, SUGGESTS THAT STATE OF THE ART DCN PERFORMANCE WITH LARGE DATASETS MIGHT YET BE IMPROVED AT THE EXPENSE OF A HIGHER COMPUTING TIME.

"RAJESH K;BHASKARI D";MULTICLASS CLASSIFICATION USING CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORKS FOR PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION OF AYURVEDIC PLANTS;AYURVEDA IS THE TRADITIONAL MEDICINE SYSTEM OF INDIA. THE INGREDIENTS FROM WHICH AYURVEDIC MEDICINES ARE MADE ARE MOSTLY HERBAL AND MINERAL IN NATURE. ALSO, THERE ARE MANY HERBAL HOME REMEDIES IN INDIA FOR GENERAL AILMENTS. THIS KNOWLEDGE HAS BEEN PASSED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION IN LARGE JOINT FAMILIES. THIS KNOWLEDGE IS SLOWLY FADING AWAY IN THE CURRENT GENERATION OF NUCLEAR FAMILIES. THE CURRENT GENERATION IS UNABLE TO IDENTIFY EVEN LOCALLY AVAILABLE PLANTS. THE AUTHORS HAVE COME UP WITH THE IDEA OF USING CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORKS FOR SOLVING THIS PROBLEM. IN THIS SOLUTION, THE IMAGES OF LEAVES ARE USED TO IDENTIFY THE PLANT. THIS PROBLEM IS A CASE OF MULTI-CLASS CLASSIFICATION. A LEAF IMAGE DATABASE IS CREATED AND A NEURAL NETWORK MODEL IS BUILT USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN). KERAS DEEP LEARNING FRAMEWORK WITH TENSORFLOW AS BACKEND, IS USED FOR THIS PURPOSE. THE WORK PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER IS A PART OF LARGER RESEARCH WORK IN THIS AREA.

RATHOR S;ENSEMBLE BASED PLANT SPECIES RECOGNITION SYSTEM USING FUSION OF HOG AND KAZE APPROACH;RECOGNITION OF PLANT SPECIES BASED ON IMAGES OF LEAVES HAS BEEN ONE OF THE IMPORTANT CHALLENGES FACED IN THE FIELD OF MACHINE LEARNING. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A MACHINE LEARNING-BASED MODEL WHICH CAN AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACT RELEVANT FEATURES LIKE EDGES, SHAPE, ETC. USING TWO FEATURE EXTRACTION ALGORITHMS: HISTOGRAM OF ORIENTED GRADIENTS AND KAZE. THE FEATURE VECTORS ARE COMBINED TO FORM A FINAL VECTOR WHICH IS THEN FED INTO 3Â CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM), K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS (KNN), AND RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM.

USUALLY PLANTS ARE RECOGNIZED BY LEAF AND ITS CHARACTERISTICS LIKE SHAPE, TEXTURE, VEIN STRUCTURE, COLOR ETC. A SYSTEM IS DEVELOPED WHICH RECOGNIZES PLANTS AUTOMATICALLY BASED ON LEAF STRUCTURE USING IMAGE PROCESSING. MOREOVER EVOLUTIONARY CHANGES ARE ALSO TAKING PLACE IN PLANTS AND IT HAS IMPACT ON IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION. IMAGE DATA BASE AND RELATED INFORMATION IS STORED ON CLOUD. SHAPE MEASURE INCLUDE AREA, PERIMETER, RATIO OF MAJORAXISLENGTH AND MINORAXISLENGTH, VEIN STRUCTURE INDICATING ANGLE OF SUB VEINS WITH MAJOR VEIN, TEXTURE ARE THE MAJOR FEATURE USED. BOTANISTS VISIT REMOTE PLACES, JUNGLES WHERE THE PLANTS NEED TO BE IDENTIFIED AND CLASSIFIED. SO AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO DEVELOP AN AUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM WHERE IN AN IMAGE OF LEAF IS CAPTURED BY ANY SMART PHONE, UPLOADED ON CLOUD, WHERE IMAGE AVAILABLE AND COMPLETE DATA BASE IS TRAINED.

HOWEVER, IT IS UNDER THREAT FROM WILD FIRES AND INVASIVE SPECIES. MUCH OF THE WORK OF MANAGING THIS NATURAL RESOURCE, SUCH AS REMOVING ALIEN VEGETATION OR FIGHTING WILD FIRES, IS DONE BY VOLUNTEERS AND CASUAL WORKERS. THE FYNBOS LEAF OPTICAL RECOGNITION APPLICATION (FLORA) WAS DEVELOPED TO ASSIST IN THE RECOGNITION OF PLANTS OF THE CFK. THE FIRST VERSION OF FLORA WAS DEVELOPED AS A RAPID PROTOTYPE IN MATLAB, BUT SUFFERED FROM SLOW PERFORMANCE AND DID NOT RUN AS A LIGHTWEIGHT STANDALONE EXECUTABLE. FLORA WAS THUS RE-DEVELOPED AS A STANDALONE C++ APPLICATION AND SUBSEQUENTLY ENHANCED USING A GRAPHICS PROCESSING UNIT (GPU). THIS PAPER PRESENTS ALL THREE VERSIONS, VIZ., THE MATLAB PROTOTYPE, THE C++ NON-ACCELERATED VERSION, AND THE C++ GPU-ACCELERATED VERSION. THE ACCURACY OF PREDICTIONS REMAINED CONSISTENT. THE C++ VERSION WAS NOTICEABLE FASTER THAN THE ORIGINAL PROTOTYPE, ACHIEVING AN AVERAGE SPEED-UP OF 42 FOR HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGES. THE GPU-ACCELERATED VERSION WAS EVEN FASTER ACHIEVING AN AVERAGE SPEED-UP OF 54.

WE INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL OF ANALYZING LEAF HEAT MAPS TO REVEAL NOVEL, HUMAN-FRIENDLY BOTANICAL INFORMATION WITH APPLICATIONS FOR EXTANT- AND FOSSIL-LEAF IDENTIFICATION. METHODS WE DEVELOPED A MANUAL SCORING SYSTEM FOR HOTSPOT LOCATIONS ON PUBLISHED COMPUTER-VISION HEAT MAPS OF CLEARED LEAVES THAT SHOWED DIAGNOSTIC REGIONS FOR FAMILY IDENTIFICATION. HEAT MAPS OF 3114 CLEARED LEAVES OF 930 GENERA IN 14 ANGIOSPERM FAMILIES WERE ANALYZED. THE TOP-5 AND TOP-1 HOTSPOT REGIONS OF HIGHEST DIAGNOSTIC VALUE WERE SCORED FOR 21 LEAF LOCATIONS. THE RESULTING DATA WERE VIEWED USING BOX PLOTS AND ANALYZED USING CLUSTER AND PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSES. WE MANUALLY IDENTIFIED SIMILAR FEATURES IN FOSSIL LEAVES TO INFORMALLY DEMONSTRATE POTENTIAL FOSSIL APPLICATIONS. RESULTS THE METHOD SUCCESSFULLY MAPPED MACHINE STRATEGY USING STANDARD BOTANICAL LANGUAGE, AND DISTINCTIVE PATTERNS EMERGED FOR EACH FAMILY. HOTSPOTS WERE CONCENTRATED ON SECONDARY VEINS (SALICACEAE, MYRTACEAE, ANACARDIACEAE), TOOTH APICES (BETULACEAE, ROSACEAE), AND ON THE LITTLE-STUDIED MARGINS OF UNTOOTHED LEAVES (RUBIACEAE, ANNONACEAE, ERICACEAE).

MEDICINAL HERBS PLAY A MAJOR PART IN CREATING AYURVEDIC DRUGS AND HOMEGROWN ITEMS. HERBAL MEDICATIONS ARE REGARDED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR SYNTHETIC DRUGS IN BOTH DEVELOPING AND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, OWING TO THEIR LACK OF ADVERSE EFFECTS. MANY MEDICINAL SPECIES ARE EXTANT IN INDIA. IDENTIFYING THOSE MEDICINAL PLANTS/LEAVES OVER A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF PLANT SPECIES IS NECESSARY AS THEY ARE MANY HEALTH BENEFITS WITH MEDICINAL PLANTS. CLASSIFICATION OF MEDICINAL LEAVES CAN BE AUTOMATED BASED ON THEIR RESPECTIVE TEXTURES, SHAPE, AND EDGE OR MARGIN OF A LEAF. IN THIS PAPER, INDIAN MEDICINAL LEAVES CLASSIFYING UTILIZING TRANSFER LEARNING BASED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS HAS BEEN PROPOSED. IN ORDER TO MAKE THE CLASSIFICATION MORE ACCURATE, THE DATA AUGMENTATION TECHNIQUE HAD BEEN UTILIZED TO ENLARGE THE DATA WHICH AVOIDS INSUFFICIENCY OF DATA. THE REGULARIZATION TECHNIQUE WAS UTILIZED TO AVOID THE MENACE OF OVERFITTING. THE DATASET CONSISTS OF 1835 IMAGES AND THIRTY DIFFERENT TYPES OF BENEFICIAL INDIAN MEDICINAL HERBS SUCH AS TULSI, JASMINE, ETC. DATA HAS BEEN TRAINED USING DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURES SUCH AS VGG16, XCEPTION, AND EFFICIENETV2 WHEREAS THESE ARCHITECTURES ACHIEVE 99.55%, 99.99%, AND 99.46% TEST ACCURACY RESPECTIVELY.

THE METHOD IS GOVERNED BY A SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS CARRIED OUT ON RECOGNITION METHOD OF AN IMMATURELY TRAINED HUMAN BRAIN. IN OTHER WORDS, A NUMBER OF CHILDREN, WHO HAVE NEVER SEEN A MAIZE AGRICULTURAL FIELD, WERE EXAMINED WHILE RECOGNIZING A MAIZE PATTERN USING AT MOST FIVE SAMPLE IMAGES. THE PROPOSED METHOD WORKS MAINLY BASED ON MORPHOLOGICAL OPERATORS FOR EXTRACTION OF FUNDAMENTAL PLANT FEATURES IN THE IMAGE. THE ADVANTAGE OF THE PROPOSED METHOD IS PRODUCING SIMILAR RESULTS TO HUMAN LABOUR WHICH IS APPROXIMATE IDENTIFICATION. THIS FINAL DECISION WAS MADE BY A FUZZY CLASSIFIER WHICH GENERATE THE DEGREE OF MEMBERSHIP TO EITHER OF WEED OR CROP PLANT GROUPS.

"SABRI N;AZIZ Z;IBRAHIM Z;ROSNI M;ABD G A";COMPARING CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORK MODELS FOR LEAF RECOGNITION;THIS RESEARCH COMPARES THE RECOGNITION PERFORMANCE BETWEEN PRETRAINED MODELS, GOOGLENET AND ALEXNET, WITH BASIC CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) FOR LEAF RECOGNITION. LATELY, CNN HAS GAINED A LOT OF INTEREST IN IMAGE PROCESSING APPLICATIONS. NUMEROUS PRETRAINED MODELS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED AND THE MOST POPULAR PRETRAINED MODELS ARE GOOGLENET AND ALEXNET. EACH MODEL HAS ITS OWN LAYERS OF CONVOLUTION AND COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY. A GREAT SUCCESS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED USING THESE CLASSIFICATION MODELS IN COMPUTER VISION AND THIS RESEARCH INVESTIGATES THEIR PERFORMANCES FOR LEAF RECOGNITION USING MALAYAKEW (MK), AN OPEN ACCESS LEAF DATASET. GOOGLENET ACHIEVES A PERFECT 100% ACCURACY, OUTPERFORMS BOTH ALEXNET AND BASIC CNN.

"SABU A;SREEKUMAR K;NAIR R";RECOGNITION OF AYURVEDIC MEDICINAL PLANTS FROM LEAVES A COMPUTER VISION APPROACH;PLANTS ARE AN INDISPENSABLE PART OF OUR ECOSYSTEM AND INDIA HAS A LONG HISTORY OF USING PLANTS AS A SOURCE OF MEDICINES. SINCE THE ADVENT OF MODERN ALLOPATHIC MEDICINE, THE USE OF TRADITIONAL MEDICINE DECLINED TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT. HOWEVER, IN RECENT YEARS, TRADITIONAL MEDICINE HAS MADE A COMEBACK FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS LIKE THEY ARE INEXPENSIVE, NONTOXIC AND DOES NOT IMPACT ANY SIDE EFFECT. DIFFERENT KIND OF MEDICINAL PLANT SPECIES ARE AVAILABLE ON EARTH BUT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY THE PLANT. CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE ACCUMULATED BY THE VILLAGERS AND TRIBAL ON MEDICINE FROM PLANTS REMAINS UNKNOWN TO THE SCIENTISTS AND URBAN PEOPLE. THIS KIND OF KNOWLEDGE IS USUALLY HANDED DOWN THROUGH GENERATIONS. OUR IMMEDIATE CONCERN IS TO PRESERVE THIS KNOWLEDGE IN DIGITAL FORM THROUGH THE CONCEPTS OF MACHINE LEARNING, PATTERN RECOGNITION AND COMPUTER VISION. A MACHINE CAN IDENTIFY A MEDICINAL PLANT THROUGH THE FEATURES EXTRACTED FROM THE LEAF IMAGES, TOGETHER WITH A CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM. THIS PAPER PROPOSES A COMPUTER VISION APPROACH FOR THE RECOGNITION OF AYURVEDIC MEDICINAL PLANT SPECIES FOUND IN WESTERN GHATS OF INDIA. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM USES A COMBINATION OF SURF AND HOG FEATURES EXTRACTED FROM LEAF IMAGES AND A CLASSIFICATION USING K-NN CLASSIFIER.

THE UNMANNED AGRICULTURAL AERIAL SYSTEM (UAAS) HAS DEVELOPED RAPIDLY IN CHINA. IT HAS BEEN USED ON SUPPLEMENTARY POLLINATION AND AERIAL SPRAYING DURING THE HYBRID OSR SEED PRODUCTION. THIS STUDY DEVELOPED A NEW METHOD TO RAPIDLY RECOGNIZE THE MALE OSR PLANTS AND EXTRACT THE ROW CENTER LINE FOR SUPPORTING THE UAAS NAVIGATION. A MALE OSR PLANT RECOGNITION MODEL WAS CONSTRUCTED BASED ON THE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN). THE SEQUENCE IMAGES OF MALE OSR PLANTS WERE EXTRACTED, THE FEATURE REGIONS AND POINTS WERE OBTAINED FROM THE IMAGES THROUGH MORPHOLOGICAL AND BOUNDARY PROCESS METHODS AND HORIZONTAL SEGMENTATION, RESPECTIVELY. THE MALE OSR PLANT IMAGE RECOGNITION ACCURACIES OF DIFFERENT CNN STRUCTURES AND SEGMENTATION SIZES WERE DISCUSSED. THE MALE OSR PLANT ROW CENTER LINES WERE FITTED USING THE LEAST-SQUARES METHOD (LSM) AND HOUGH TRANSFORM. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE SEGMENTATION ALGORITHM COULD SEGMENT THE MALE OSR PLANTS FROM THE COMPLEX BACKGROUND. THE HIGHEST AVERAGE RECOGNITION ACCURACY WAS 93.54%, AND THE MINIMUM LOSS FUNCTION VALUE WAS 0.2059 WITH THREE CONVOLUTIONAL LAYERS, ONE FULLY CONNECTED LAYER, AND A SEGMENTATION SIZE OF 40 PIX Ã— 40 PIX. THE LSM IS BETTER FOR CENTER LINE FITTING. THE AVERAGE RECOGNITION MODEL ACCURACIES OF ORIGINAL INPUT IMAGES WERE 98% AND 94%, AND THE AVERAGE ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERRORS (RMSE) OF ANGLE WERE 3.22â—¦ AND 1.36â—¦ UNDER CLOUDY DAY AND SUNNY DAY LIGHTING CONDITIONS, RESPECTIVELY. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL OF USING DIGITAL IMAGING TECHNOLOGY TO RECOGNIZE THE MALE OSR PLANT ROW FOR UAAS VISUAL NAVIGATION ON THE APPLICATIONS OF HYBRID OSR SUPPLEMENTARY POLLINATION AND AERIAL SPRAYING, WHICH WOULD BE A MEANINGFUL SUPPLEMENT IN PRECISION AGRICULTURE.

SUTO J;PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION WITH SHALLOW AND DEEP LEARNING A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY;NOWADAYS THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS KNOWN PLANT SPECIES ON THE EARTH AND MANY ARE STILL UNKNOWN YET. THE PROCESS OF PLANT CLASSIFICATION CAN BE PERFORMED USING DIFFERENT WAYS BUT THE MOST POPULAR APPROACH IS BASED ON PLANT LEAF CHARACTERISTICS. MOST TYPES OF PLANTS HAVE UNIQUE LEAF CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS SHAPE, COLOR, AND TEXTURE. SINCE MACHINE LEARNING AND VISION CONSIDERABLY DEVELOPED IN THE PAST DECADE, AUTOMATIC PLANT SPECIES (OR LEAF) RECOGNITION HAS BECOME POSSIBLE. RECENTLY, THE AUTOMATED LEAF CLASSIFICATION IS A STANDALONE RESEARCH AREA INSIDE MACHINE LEARNING AND SEVERAL SHALLOW AND DEEP METHODS WERE PROPOSED TO RECOGNIZE LEAF TYPES. FROM 2007 TO PRESENT DAYS SEVERAL RESEARCH PAPERS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED IN THIS TOPIC. IN OLDER STUDIES THE CLASSIFIER WAS A SHALLOW METHOD WHILE IN CURRENT WORKS MANY RESEARCHERS APPLIED DEEP NETWORKS FOR CLASSIFICATION. DURING THE OVERVIEW OF PLANT LEAF CLASSIFICATION LITERATURE, WE FOUND AN INTERESTING DEFICIENCY (LACK OF HYPER-PARAMETER SEARCH) AND A KEY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STUDIES (DIFFERENT TEST SETS). THIS WORK GIVES AN OVERALL REVIEW ABOUT THE EFFICIENCY OF SHALLOW AND DEEP METHODS UNDER DIFFERENT TEST CONDITIONS. IT CAN BE A BASIS TO FURTHER RESEARCH. Â© 2020 - IOS PRESS AND THE AUTHORS.

HOWEVER, SUCH LARGE DATASETS ARE NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE OR AFFORDABLE IN MANY APPLICATIONS AREAS WHERE WE WOULD LIKE TO APPLY DCNS, HAVING ONLY DATASETS OF THE ORDER OF A FEW THOUSANDS LABELLED IMAGES, ACQUIRED AND ANNOTATED THROUGH LENGHTY AND COSTLY PROCESSES (SUCH AS IN PLANT RECOGNITION, MEDICAL IMAGING, ETC.). IN SUCH CASES DCNS DO NOT GENERALLY SHOW COMPETITIVE PERFORMANCE AND ONE MUST RESORT TO FINE-TUNE NETWORKS THAT WERE COSTLY PRETRAINED WITH LARGE GENERIC DATASETS WHERE THERE IS NO A-PRIORI GUARANTEE THAT THEY WOULD WORK WELL IN SPECIALIZED DOMAINS. IN THIS WORK WE PROPOSE TO TRAIN DCNS WITH A GREEDY LAYERWISE METHOD, ANALOGOUS TO THAT USED IN UNSUPERVISED DEEP NETWORKS. WE SHOW HOW, FOR SMALL DATASETS, THIS METHOD OUTPERFORMS DCNS WHICH DO NOT USE PRETRAINED MODELS AND RESULTS REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE WITH OTHER METHODS. ADDITIONALLY, OUR METHOD LEARNS MORE INTERPRETABLE AND CLEANER VISUAL FEATURES. OUR RESULTS ARE ALSO COMPETITIVE AS COMPARED WITH CONVOLUTIONAL METHODS BASED ON PRETRAINED MODELS WHEN APPLIED TO GENERAL PURPOSE DATASETS, AND WE OBTAIN THEM WITH MUCH SMALLER DATASETS (1.2 MILLION VS. 10K IMAGES) AT A FRACTION OF THE COMPUTATIONAL COST.

"TAO L;CHENG C";PLANT IDENTIFICATION BASED ON IMAGE SET ANALYSIS;PLANT IDENTIFICATION IS CRUCIAL IN PLANT PROTECTION, CROP BREEDING AND AGRICULTURE RESEARCH AREA. WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, COMPUTER VISION-BASED PLANT IDENTIFICATION IS AN EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT SOLUTION. MANY TRADITION PLANT IDENTIFICATION ALGORITHMS UTILIZE ONLY ONE TYPE OF PLANT IMAGES, SUCH AS IMAGES FROM LEAVES, FLOWERS AND STEMS ETC., WHICH MAY BRING MISCLASSIFICATIONS. IN ORDER TO RECOGNIZE PLANT ACCURATELY, WE PROPOSE A NEW PLANT IDENTIFICATION SCHEME BASED ON IMAGE SET ANALYSIS. IN THIS METHOD, USES IMAGE SET AS A TAXONOMIC UNIT, EACH IMAGE SET CONSISTS OF MULTIPLE IMAGES (WHOLE PLANT, FRUITS, LEAVES, FLOWERS, STEMS, BRANCHES, LEAVES SCAN), THE CHARACTERISTICS OF PLANTS ARE FUSED TOGETHER AS A BASIS FOR PLANT IDENTIFICATION. COMPARED TO THE TRADITIONAL SINGLE FEATURE, THIS STUDY HAS MORE CHARACTERISTICS AND PROVIDES MORE INFORMATION IN THE CLASSIFICATION PROCESS. A FACE RECOGNITION ALGORITHM BASED ON IMAGE COLLECTION IS USED IN OUR RESEARCH, FOR EXAMPLE: AHISD/CHISD (AFFINE/CONVEX HULL BASED IMAGE SET DISTANCE), PLRC (PAIRWISE LINEAR REGRESSION CLASSIFICATION), SSDML (SET-TO-SET DISTANCE METRIC LEARNING), SANP (SPARSE APPROXIMATED NEAREST POINT), RNP (REGULARIZED NEAREST POINTS). DATA SET CONTAINS 64,150 PLANT IMAGES, IT CAN BE DIVIDED INTO 369 TRAINING SET (EACH TRAINING SET CONTAINS 50 PICTURES) AND 914 TEST SETS (EACH TEST SET CONTAINS 50 PICTURE). THE RESULTS SHOW THAT CHISD HAS THE HIGHEST RECOGNITION RATE, AT 77.02%, WHICH IS MORE SUITABLE FOR REQUIRING HIGHER ACCURACY. RNP IDENTIFIES A PLANT CLASS TOOK AN AVERAGE OF 0.75 S, THE ALGORITHM IS MORE SUITABLE FOR THE OCCASION WITH HIGHER TIME REQUIREMENT.

"BRILHADOR A;SERRARENS D;LOPES F";A COMPUTER VISION APPROACH FOR AUTOMATIC MEASUREMENT OF THE INTERPLANT SPACING;GLOBAL FOOD DEMAND IS INCREASING EVERY YEAR AND IT IS NEEDED TO RESPOND TO THIS DEMAND. IN ADDITION, SOME CROPS SUCH AS CORN, WHICH IS THE MOST PRODUCED GRAIN IN THE WORLD, IS USED AS FOOD, FEED, BIO-ENERGY AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL PURPOSES. THUS, IT IS NEEDED THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT MAKE POSSIBLE TO PRODUCE MORE FROM LESS LAND. IN PARTICULAR, THE CORN CROP IS SENSITIVE TO ITS SPATIAL ARRANGEMENT AND ANY VARIATION IN PLANT DISTRIBUTION PATTERN CAN LEAD TO REDUCTION IN CORN PRODUCTION. NOWADAYS, THE UNIFORMITY OF THE PLANT SPACING IS CHECKED MANUALLY BY AGRONOMISTS IN ORDER TO PREDICT POSSIBLE PRODUCTION LOSSES. IN THIS CONTEXT, THIS WORK PROPOSES AN AUTOMATIC APPROACH FOR MEASURING THE SPACING BETWEEN CORN PLANTS IN THE EARLY STAGES OF GROWTH. THE PROPOSED APPROACH IS BASED ON COMPUTER VISION TECHNIQUES IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE AUTOMATIC INTER-PLANT SPACING MEASUREMENT FROM IMAGES IN A SIMPLE AND EFFICIENT WAY, ALLOWING ITS USE ON DEVICES WITH LOW COMPUTATIONAL POWER SUCH AS SMART PHONES AND TABLETS. AN IMAGE DATASET WAS BUILT AS AN ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTION OF THIS WORK CONTAINING 2186 CORN PLANTS IN TWO CONDITIONS: TILLAGE AFTER THE APPLICATION OF HERBICIDE (TH) WITH 1387 CORN PLANTS AND CONVENTIONAL TILLAGE (CT) WITH 799 CORN PLANTS. THE DATASET IS AVAILABLE AT URL: HTTP://GITHUB.COM/BRILHADOR/CORNSPACING. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ACHIEVE 90% OF PRECISION AND 92% OF SENSITIVITY IN CORN PLANT IDENTIFICATION. REGARDING THE AUTOMATIC MEASUREMENT OF THE INTERPLANT SPACING, THE RESULTS SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES FROM THE SAME MEASUREMENTS TAKEN MANUALLY, INDICATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH IN TWO DISTINCT TYPES OF PLANTING.

"THANIKKAL J;DUBEY A;THOMAS M";DEEPMORPHO ALGORITHM DMA FOR MEDICINAL LEAVES FEATURES EXTRACTION;PRESENTLY, FOR THE IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION OF IMAGES, VARIOUS DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES ARE BEING USED. IN THESE TECHNIQUES, THE WHOLE IMAGE IS CONSIDERED TO PRODUCE SIMILAR FEATURE SETS FOR MANY IMAGES. AS A RESULT, THIS MECHANISM LOSES MANY OF ITS FEATURES AT THE FINAL STAGE. THEREFORE, TO ANALYZE AND IDENTIFY MEDICINAL LEAVES THROUGH AN ARTIFICIAL EYE OF BOTANISTS, IT WAS EMPHASIZED THAT THE LEAF IMAGE FEATURES SHOULD REMAIN PRESERVED TILL THE FINAL STAGE OF CLASSIFICATION FOR BETTER ACCURACY. THE EXISTING PLANT IDENTIFICATION APPROACHES ARE TRAINED USING THE LEAF IMAGES. SO LEAF FEATURES ARE LOST IN THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE CONVOLUTION PROCESS AND THE SAME FEATURE VALUES ARE GENERATED FOR SIMILAR TYPE LEAF IMAGES. THIS RAISES AMBIGUITY IN THE RESULTS AND AFFECTS THE ACCURACY OF LEAF IMAGE IDENTIFICATION. BUT HERE, IN THIS PROPOSED DEEP LEARNING-BASED PLANT LEAVES MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURE RECOGNITION SYSTEM, LEAF MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES ARE USED TO TRAIN THE SYSTEM. MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES ARE IDENTIFIED TO RECOGNIZE A PLANT LEAF. HERE, MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES OF MEDICINAL PLANT LEAVES, VENATION, SHAPES, APICES, AND BASES ARE EXTRACTED AND ANALYZED TO PREDICT THE IMAGE CLASS. SO, THE LEAF FEATURES REMAIN PERSEVERED UNTIL THE FINAL STAGE. THE PROPOSED FEATURE RECOGNITION ANALYSIS IMPROVES THE ACCURACY OF THE LEAF IDENTIFICATION METHOD. IN THIS, MORE THAN 300 LEAVES FROM 18 DIFFERENT PLANT FAMILIES ARE COLLECTED AND TRAINED TO BUILD THE DEEP LEARNING CLASSIFIER AND ACHIEVE 96\% ACCURACY.

"ZHANG W;HUA X";PLANT IDENTIFICATION WITH NOISY WEB DATA;ONE OF THE MAIN PROBLEMS IN IMAGE BASED PLANT IDENTIFICATION HAS BEEN THE LACK OF QUALITY TRAINING IMAGE DATA. A FEW ATTEMPTS FOR SOLVING THIS PROBLEM THROUGH GENERATING HIGH QUALITY PLANT IMAGES FROM CROWD SOURCED WEB IMAGE COLLECTIONS LIKE FLICKR ARE PROPOSED IN THIS PAPER. THESE METHODS TRY TO AUTOMATICALLY IDENTIFY CORRECT AND INFORMATIVE TRAINING IMAGES FROM THOSE WEB IMAGES, WHICH TYPICALLY HAVE VERY NOISY METADATA (FOR EXAMPLE, USER TAGS IN FLICKR), TO ENHANCE EXISTING MANUALLY LABELED TRAINING SET. FIRSTLY, FOR EACH PLANT, A SET OF IMAGES IS COLLECTED FROM SEARCHING FLICKR BY USING THE PLANT NAME AS THE QUERY. THEN, IMAGES ARE CLUSTERED INTO VISUALLY CONSISTENT CLUSTERS, AND IN EACH CLUSTER HOPEFULLY A MAJORITY OF THE IMAGES ARE ALL RELEVANT OR IRRELEVANT TO THE PARTICULAR PLANT. FROM THESE CLUSTERS, A MANAGED PLANT IMAGE DATA SET FROM IMAGECLEF IS USED AS REFERENCE TO AUTOMATICALLY SELECT THE HIGHEST QUALITY CLUSTER FOR EACH PLANT. THE IMAGE QUALITY OF THE SELECTED CLUSTERS IS FURTHER IMPROVED BY TWO ALGORITHMS: AN ITERATIVE METHOD AND IMAGE SIMILARITY BASED RANKING. WE SHOW THAT THE LARGER TRAINING DATA SET AUTOMATICALLY SELECTED BY THIS METHOD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES THE ACCURACY OF IMAGE BASED PLANT IDENTIFICATION. IN ADDITION, THIS APPROACH IS A GENERIC SOLUTION TO ALMOST ALL IMAGE RECOGNITION PROBLEMS AS LONG AS ADDITIONAL (NOISY) TRAINING DATA CAN BE OBTAINED FROM THE INTERNET AUTOMATICALLY.

THIS MEANS THEY ARE CAPTURED ON A PLAIN BACKGROUND RATHER THAN BEING READILY IDENTIFIED IN THEIR NATURAL SURROUNDINGS, WHICH OFTEN INVOLVE COMPLEX AND NOISY BACKGROUNDS. WHILE DEEP LEARNING (DL) BASED METHODS HAVE MADE CONSIDERABLE STRIDES IN RECENT TIMES, THEIR POTENTIAL HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN MAXIMISED BECAUSE THEY ARE TRAINED WITH SAMPLES WHICH ARE NOT ALWAYS FULLY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE INTRA-CLASS AND INTER-CLASS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PLANT SPECIES CONCERNED. THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THIS CHALLENGE BY INCORPORATING MUTUAL INFORMATION INTO A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) MODEL TO SELECT SAMPLES FOR THE TRAINING, VALIDATION, AND TESTING SETS BASED ON A SIMILARITY MEASURE. A CRITICAL COMPARATIVE EVALUATION OF THIS NEW CNN MEDICINAL PLANT CLASSIFICATION MODEL INCORPORATING A MUTUAL INFORMATION GUIDED TRAINING (MIGT) ALGORITHM FOR SAMPLE SELECTION, CORROBORATES THE SUPERIOR CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE ACHIEVED FOR THE VNPLANT-200 DATASET, WITH AN AVERAGE ACCURACY OF MORE THAN 97%, WHILE THE PRECISION AND RECALL VALUES ARE ALSO CONSISTENTLY ABOVE 97%. THIS IS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN EXISTING CNN CLASSIFICATION METHODS FOR THIS DATASET AS IT CRUCIALLY MEANS FALSE POSITIVE RATES ARE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THUS AFFORDING IMPROVED IDENTIFICATION RELIABILITY.

"SIMON S;JACOB R;NALPANTIDIS L";WEED PLANT IDENTIFICATION AND REMOVAL USING MACHINE VISION AND ROBOTICS SELFSUPERVISED CONTRASTIVE LEARNING ON AGRICULTURAL IMAGES;WEEDS ARE UNDESIRED PLANTS THAT GROW AROUND CROPS OR PLANTS OF DESIRE. FARMERS AND GARDENERS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FIGHTING AGAINST WEEDS BECAUSE WEED REMOVAL IS A TIRING AND LABORIOUS PROCESS. THAT IS WHERE PRECISION FARMING BECOMES THE NEED OF THE HOUR. TO IMPLEMENT PRECISION FARMING FOR WEED REMOVAL, WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT DETECTS WEEDS FROM CROPS AND ALSO A ROBOTIC SYSTEM THAT WILL EXECUTE THE WEED REMOVAL PROCESS USING A ROBOTIC ARM, MIMICKING THE HUMAN ACTION OF REMOVING WEEDS. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM USES THE YOLOV4 ALGORITHM TO DETECT WEEDS AND CROPS IN REAL TIME AND REMOVES THE DETECTED WEEDS USING A WEEDING ROBOT. THE SYSTEM PROVES TO BE A GOOD SOLUTION OF REMOVING WEEDS FROM LAND. Â© 2022 IEEE. AGRICULTURE EMERGES AS A PROMINENT APPLICATION DOMAIN FOR ADVANCED COMPUTER VISION ALGORITHMS. AS MUCH AS DEEP LEARNING APPROACHES CAN HELP SOLVE PROBLEMS SUCH AS PLANT DETECTION, THEY RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF ANNOTATED IMAGES FOR TRAINING. HOWEVER, RELEVANT AGRICULTURAL DATASETS ARE SCARCE AND AT THE SAME TIME, GENERIC WELL-ESTABLISHED IMAGE DATASETS SUCH AS IMAGENET DO NOT NECESSARILY CAPTURE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF AGRICULTURAL ENVIRONMENTS. THIS OBSERVATION HAS MOTIVATED US TO EXPLORE THE APPLICABILITY OF SELF-SUPERVISED CONTRASTIVE LEARNING ON AGRICULTURAL IMAGES. OUR APPROACH CONSIDERS NUMEROUS NON-ANNOTATED AGRICULTURAL IMAGES, WHICH ARE EASY TO OBTAIN, AND USES THEM TO PRE-TRAIN DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS. WE THEN REQUIRE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF ANNOTATED IMAGES TO FINE-TUNE THOSE NETWORKS IN A SUPERVISED TRAINING MANNER FOR RELEVANT DOWNSTREAM TASKS, SUCH AS PLANT CLASSIFICATION OR SEGMENTATION. TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, CONTRASTIVE SELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING HAS NOT BEEN EXPLORED BEFORE IN THE AREA OF AGRICULTURAL IMAGES. OUR RESULTS REVEAL THAT IT OUTPERFORMS CONVENTIONAL DEEP LEARNING APPROACHES IN CLASSIFICATION DOWNSTREAM TASKS, ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL AMOUNTS OF AVAILABLE ANNOTATED TRAINING IMAGES WHERE UP TO 14% INCREASE OF AVERAGE TOP-1 CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY HAS BEEN OBSERVED. FURTHERMORE, THE COMPUTATIONAL COST FOR GENERATING DATA-SPECIFIC PRE-TRAINED WEIGHTS IS FAIRLY LOW, ALLOWING ONE TO GENERATE EASILY NEW PRE-TRAINED WEIGHTS FOR ANY CUSTOM MODEL ARCHITECTURE OR TASK.

USING VISUAL MORPHOLOGICAL TRAITS LIKE THE SIZE, COLOR, AND TEXTURE OF THE LEAVES AND FLOWERS, IT IS POSSIBLE TO AUTOMATE THE IDENTIFICATION OF PLANTS. IN THIS STUDY, WE DEMONSTRATE THE USE OF MACHINE LEARNING AND IMAGE PROCESSING TO IDENTIFY UNCOMMON MEDICINAL PLANTS WITH HIGH ACCURACY. THE LEAVES AND PETALS OF RARE MEDICINAL PLANTS USED IN AYURVEDIC MEDICINE WERE SCANNED AND TURNED INTO A DATABASE FOR THIS STUDY. IMAGES WERE CAPTURED OF BOTH THE ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR SIDES OF LEAVES AND FLOWERS. ACCORDING TO THEIR DISTINCT FEATURE COMBINATION, LEAVES ARE CATEGORIZED. THE SUCCESS RATES OF IDENTIFYING PLANTS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE AS HIGH AS 98% IN TESTING.

"SRIVASTAVA V;KHUNTETA A";COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF LEAF CLASSIFICATION AND RECOGNITION BY DIFFERENT SVM CLASSIFIERS;THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE LEAF SHAPE EXTRACTION FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF PLANT. LEAF SHAPE IS AN IMPORTANT PARAMETER WHICH ARE FREQUENTLY USED TO IDENTIFY AND CLASSIFY THE PLANT SPECIES. BESIDES MANY CHALLENGES OCCURRED IN PLANT CLASSIFICATION, IT IS VERY USEFUL TECHNIQUE TO STUDY THE LIVESTOCK SYSTEMS, CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY. THE CAMERA CAPTURES THE IMAGE FOLLOWED BY SEGMENTING THE REQUIRED LEAVES FROM THE IMAGE AND THEN A SINGLE LEAF IS SEGMENTED USING OTSU'S SEGMENTATION. A NEW APPROACH IS USED TO EXTRACT 14 FEATURES FROM THE LEAF USING SHAPE DETECTOR AND CLASSIFYING 16 DIFFERENT KIND OF PLANTS WITH SVM CLASSIFIER.

"VALLIAMMAL N;GEETHALAKSHMI S";HYBRID IMAGE SEGMENTATION ALGORITHM FOR LEAF RECOGNITION AND CHARACTERIZATION;"PLANTS PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN BOTH HUMAN LIFE AND OTHER LIVES THAT EXIST ON THE EARTH. DUE TO ENVIRONMENTAL DETERIORATION AND LACK OF AWARENESS, MANY RARE PLANT SPECIES ARE AT THE MARGINS OF EXTINCTION. DESPITE THE GREAT ADVANCES MADE IN BOTANY, THERE ARE MANY PLANTS YET TO BE DISCOVERED, CLASSIFIED, AND UTILIZED; UNKNOWN PLANTS ARE TREASURES WAITING TO BE FOUND. LEAF CLASSIFICATION AND RECOGNITION FOR PLANT IDENTIFICATION PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN ALL THESE ENDEAVORS. THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE WORK REPORTED ON LEAVES, FLOWER AND FRUIT IMAGE PROCESSING AND RECOGNITION. IN RECENT YEARS, SEVERAL RESEARCHERS HAVE DEDICATED THEIR WORK TO LEAF CHARACTERISATION. AS AN INHERENT TRAIT, LEAF VEIN DEFINITELY CONTAINS THE IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PLANT SPECIES RECOGNITION DESPITE ITS COMPLEX MODALITY. A NEW APPROACH THAT COMBINES A THRESHOLDING METHOD AND H-MAXIMA TRANSFORMATION BASED METHOD IS PROPOSED TO EXTRACT THE LEAF VEINS. A PRELIMINARY SEGMENTATION BASED ON THE INTENSITY HISTOGRAM OF LEAF IMAGES IS FIRST CARRIED OUT TO COARSELY DETERMINE VEIN REGIONS USING THRESHOLDING. THIS IS FOLLOWED BY A FINE SEGMENTATION USING H MAXIMA TRANSFORMATION BASED METHOD FOR OBJECT PIXEL AS ITS INPUTS. COMPARED WITH OTHER METHODS, EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THIS COMBINED APPROACH IS CAPABLE OF EXTRACTING MORE ACCURATE VENATION MODALITY OF THE LEAF FOR THE SUBSEQUENT VEIN PATTERN CLASSIFICATION. THE APPROACH CAN ALSO REDUCE THE COMPUTING TIME COMPARED WITH OTHER APPROACH.

"DHAWALE V;TIDKE J;DUDUL S";EFFICIENT CLASSIFICATION OF POLLEN GRAINS USING COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE APPROACH;POLLEN GRAINS PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM OF PLANTS. POLLEN MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS ARE VERY USEFUL IN PLANT CLASSIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF PLANTS. POLLEN STUDIES ARE WIDELY USED IN ALLERGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY RESEARCH, FOSSIL FUEL EXPLORATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, FOOD, PHARMACEUTICAL, AND COSMETIC INDUSTRY, BIOTECHNOLOGY, AND SO MANY OTHER FIELDS. HENCE CLASSIFICATION OF POLLEN GRAINS IS A CHALLENGE THAT CAN BE EFFECTIVELY DONE BY COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE APPROACH. THE TRADITIONAL METHOD OF POLLEN CLASSIFICATION ANALYSES THE POLLEN MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS USING MICROSCOPY. THIS PROCEDURE IS TEDIOUS AND REQUIRES EXPERTS FROM THE FIELD OF PALYNOLOGY. WITH A VIEW TO EXTRACT FEATURES FROM POLLEN IMAGES, A NEW CLASSIFICATION STRATEGY IS DEVELOPED WHICH PROPOSES IMAGE HISTOGRAM COEFFICIENTS IN ADDITION TO IMAGE STATISTICS AND SHAPE DESCRIPTOR. THE SUITABILITY OF CLASSIFIERS BASED ON MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON (MLP) NEURAL NETWORK AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) IS EXPLORED WITH THE OPTIMIZATION OF THEIR RESPECTIVE PARAMETERS IN VIEW OF REDUCTION IN TIME AS WELL AS SPACE COMPLEXITY. PERFORMANCE OF TWO CLASSIFIERS HAS BEEN COMPARED WITH RESPECT TO MSE, NMSE, AND CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY. THE AVERAGE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY OF MLP COMPRISING OF TWO HIDDEN LAYERS IS FOUND TO BE SUPERIOR (95 % ON CROSS VALIDATION DATASET) TO SVM BASED CLASSIFIER. FINALLY, OPTIMAL CLASSIFICATION STRATEGY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED, WHICH COULD BE EASILY MODIFIED TO CLASSIFY MORE THAN 10 SPECIES.

RESEARCHERS HAVE MADE PLANT RECOGNITION BASED ON LEAF CHARACTERISTICS. THE LEAF IMAGE-BASED PLANT RECOGNITION IN VIEW OF DIFFERENT ANGLES IS A NEW CHALLENGE. IN THIS STUDY, THE RESEARCH ON THE PLANT RECOGNITION WAS CONDUCTED BASED ON LEAF IMAGES RESULTED FROM 3D STEREO CAMERA. THE 3D IMAGES ARE VERY INFLUENTIAL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTER VISION THEORY, WHICH CAN PROVIDE MORE DETAILED INFORMATION OF AN OBJECT. ONE OF THE INFORMATION THAT CAN BE OBTAINED IS ABOUT THE POSITION OF THE OBJECT IN ITS IMAGE WITH THE BACKGROUND AS WELL AS OF THE CAMERA. ONE OF THE WAYS USED TO OBTAIN SUCH INFORMATION IS TO CALCULATE THE DISPARITY. HOWEVER, THIS METHOD WILL ONLY TELL THE POSITION OF THE OBJECT COMPARED TO OTHER OBJECTS WITHOUT THAT OF RANGE. SUM ABSOLUTE DIFFERENT (SAD) IS A METHOD THAT CAN BE USED TO FIND THE DISPARITY VALUE. THE SAD METHOD DOES NOT REQUIRE HEAVY COMPUTATIONS AND LONG PROCESS. BEFORE CALCULATING THE DISPARITY, ALL THE IMAGES SHOULD BE PREVIOUSLY SEGMENTED. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS SEGMENTATION IS TO SEPARATE ALL THE OBJECTS FROM THE BACKGROUND. FURTHERMORE, FILTERING AND POLYNOMIAL TRANSFORMATION AT THE RESULTS OF DISPARITY IS NECESSARY TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF RESULTANT IMAGES.

"WÃ–BER W;MEHNEN L;SYKACEK P;MEIMBERG H";INVESTIGATING EXPLANATORY FACTORS OF MACHINE LEARNING MODELS FOR PLANT CLASSIFICATION;RECENT PROGRESS IN MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING HAS ENABLED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PLANT AND CROP DETECTION USING SYSTEMATIC INSPECTION OF THE LEAF SHAPES AND OTHER MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS FOR IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS FOR PRECISION FARMING. HOWEVER, THE MODELS USED FOR THIS APPROACH TEND TO BECOME BLACK-BOX MODELS, IN THE SENSE THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO TRACE CHARACTERS THAT ARE THE BASE FOR THE CLASSIFICATION. THE INTERPRETABILITY IS THEREFORE LIMITED AND THE EXPLANATORY FACTORS MAY NOT BE BASED ON REASONABLE VISIBLE CHARACTERS. WE INVESTIGATE THE EXPLANATORY FACTORS OF RECENT MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING MODELS FOR PLANT CLASSIFICATION TASKS. BASED ON A DAUCUS CAROTA AND A BETA VULGARIS IMAGE DATA SET, WE IMPLEMENT PLANT CLASSIFICATION MODELS AND COMPARE THOSE MODELS BY THEIR PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS EXPLAINABILITY. FOR COMPARISON WE IMPLEMENTED A FEED FORWARD CONVOLUTIONAL NEURONAL NETWORK AS A DEFAULT MODEL. TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE, WE TRAINED AN UNSUPERVISED BAYESIAN GAUSSIAN PROCESS LATENT VARIABLE MODEL AS WELL AS A CONVOLUTIONAL AUTOENCODER FOR FEATURE EXTRACTION AND RELY ON A SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE FOR CLASSIFICATION. THE EXPLANATORY FACTORS OF ALL MODELS WERE EXTRACTED AND ANALYZED. THE EXPERIMENTS SHOW, THAT FEED FORWARD CONVOLUTIONAL NEURONAL NETWORKS (98.24% AND 96.10% MEAN ACCURACY) OUTPERFORMS THE BAYESIAN GAUSSIAN PROCESS LATENT VARIABLE PIPELINE (92.08% AND 94.31% MEAN ACCURACY) AS WELL AS THE CONVOLUTIONAL AUTOENCEODER PIPELINE (92.38% AND 93.28% MEAN ACCURACY) BASED APPROACHES IN TERMS OF CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY, EVEN THOUGH NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR BETA VULGARIS IMAGES. ADDITIONALLY, WE FOUND THAT THE NEURONAL NETWORK USED BIOLOGICAL UNINTERPRETABLE IMAGE REGIONS FOR THE PLANT CLASSIFICATION TASK. IN CONTRAST TO THAT, THE UNSUPERVISED LEARNING MODELS RELY ON EXPLAINABLE VISUAL CHARACTERS. WE CONCLUDE THAT SUPERVISED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURONAL NETWORKS MUST BE USED CAREFULLY TO ENSURE BIOLOGICAL INTERPRETABILITY. WE RECOMMEND UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING, CAREFUL FEATURE INVESTIGATION, AND STATISTICAL FEATURE ANALYSIS FOR BIOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS. Â© 2021 BY THE AUTHORS.

RECCEMANÂ® (RECONNAISSANCE MANUAL) IS A DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR OBJECT RECOGNITION DEVELOPED BY THE FRAUNHOFER IOSB. IT SUPPORTS OBJECT RECOGNITION BY AUTOMATING THE TEDIOUS TASK OF MATCHING THE OBJECT FEATURES WITH THE SET OF POSSIBLE OBJECT CLASSES, WHILE LEAVING THE ASSESSMENT OF FEATURES TO THE TRAINED HUMAN INTERPRETER. THE QUALITY OF THE FEATURES ASSESSED BY THE USER IS INFLUENCED BY SEVERAL FACTORS SUCH AS THE QUALITY OF THE IMAGE OF THE OBJECT. THESE FACTORS ARE POTENTIAL SOURCES OF ERROR, WHICH CAN LEAD TO AN INCORRECT CLASSIFICATION AND THEREFORE HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED BY THE SYSTEM. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, TWO METHODS FOR CONSIDERATION OF UNCERTAINTY IN HUMAN FEATURE ASSESSMENT - A PROBABILISTIC AND A HEURISTIC APPROACH - ARE PRESENTED AND COMPARED BASED ON AN EXPERIMENT IN THE EXEMPLARY DOMAIN OF FLOWER RECOGNITION.

THIS PAPER REPORTS OUR ATTEMPT ON CULTIVAR RECOGNITION FROM LEAVES AS A GENERAL VERY FINE-GRAINED PATTERN RECOGNITION PROBLEM, WHICH IS NOT ONLY A CHALLENGING RESEARCH PROBLEM BUT ALSO IMPORTANT FOR CULTIVAR EVALUATION, SELECTION AND PRODUCTION IN AGRICULTURE. WE PROPOSE A NOVEL LOCAL R-SYMMETRY CO-OCCURRENCE METHOD FOR CHARACTERISING DISCRIMINATIVE LOCAL SYMMETRY PATTERNS TO DISTINGUISH SUBTLE DIFFERENCES AMONG CULTIVARS. THROUGH SCALABLE AND MOVING R-RELATION RADIUS PAIRS, WE GENERATE A SET OF RADIUS SYMMETRY CO-OCCURRENCE MATRICES (RSCOM)AND THEIR MEASURES FOR DESCRIBING THE LOCAL SYMMETRY PROPERTIES OF INTERIOR REGIONS. BY VARYING THE SIZE OF THE RADIUS PAIR, THE RSCOM MEASURES LOCAL R-SYMMETRY CO-OCCURRENCE FROM GLOBAL/COARSE TO FINE SCALES. A NEW TWO-PHASE STRATEGY OF ANALYSING THE DISTRIBUTION OF LOCAL RSCOM MEASURES IS DESIGNED TO MATCH THE MULTIPLE SCALE APPEARANCE SYMMETRY PATTERN DISTRIBUTIONS OF SIMILAR CULTIVAR LEAF IMAGES.

TIWARI S;A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF DEEP LEARNING MODELS WITH HANDCRAFT FEATURES AND NONHANDCRAFT FEATURES FOR AUTOMATIC PLANT SPECIES IDENTIFICATION;THE CLASSIFICATION OF PLANTS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AIMS FOR BOTANISTS SINCE PLANTS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PART IN THE NATURAL LIFE CYCLE. IN THIS WORK, A LEAF-BASED AUTOMATIC PLANT CLASSIFICATION FRAMEWORK IS INVESTIGATED. THE AIM IS TO COMPARE TWO DIFFERENT DEEP LEARNING APPROACHES NAMED DEEP NEURAL NETWORK (DNN) AND DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN). IN THE CASE OF DEEP NEURAL NETWORK, HYBRID SHAPES AND TEXTURE FEATURES ARE UTILIZED AS HAND-CRAFTED FEATURES WHILE IN THE CASE OF THE CONVOLUTION NON-HANDCRAFT, FEATURES ARE APPLIED FOR CLASSIFICATION. THE OFFERED FRAMEWORKS ARE EVALUATED WITH A PUBLIC LEAF DATABASE. FROM THE SIMULATION RESULTS, IT IS CONFIRMED THAT THE DEEP CNN-BASED DEEP LEARNING FRAMEWORK DEMONSTRATES SUPERIOR CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE THAN THE HANDCRAFT FEATURE BASED APPROACH.

"TURKOGLU M;HANBAY D";LEAFBASED PLANT SPECIES RECOGNITION BASED ON IMPROVED LOCAL BINARY PATTERN AND EXTREME LEARNING MACHINE;OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS, MANY FEATURE EXTRACTION METHODS HAVE BEEN USED AND DEVELOPED FOR THE RECOGNITION OF PLANT SPECIES. THESE METHODS HAVE MOSTLY BEEN PERFORMED USING SEPARATION OPERATIONS FROM THE BACKGROUND BASED ON A PRE-PROCESSING STAGE. HOWEVER, THE LOCAL BINARY PATTERNS (LBP)METHOD, WHICH PROVIDES HIGH PERFORMANCE IN OBJECT RECOGNITION, IS USED TO OBTAIN TEXTURAL FEATURES FROM IMAGES WITHOUT NEED FOR A PRE-PROCESSING STAGE. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE DIFFERENT APPROACHES BASED ON LBP FOR THE RECOGNITION OF PLANT LEAVES USING EXTRACTED TEXTURE FEATURES FROM PLANT LEAVES. WHILE THE ORIGINAL LBP CONVERTS COLOR IMAGES TO GRAY TONES, THE PROPOSED METHODS ARE APPLIED BY USING THE R AND G COLOR CHANNEL OF IMAGES. IN ADDITION, WE EVALUATE THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE PROPOSED METHODS AGAINST NOISE SUCH AS SALT & PEPPER AND GAUSSIAN. LATER, THE OBTAINED FEATURES FROM THE PROPOSED METHODS WERE CLASSIFIED AND TESTED USING THE EXTREME LEARNING MACHINE (ELM)METHOD. THE EXPERIMENTAL WORKS WERE PERFORMED USING VARIOUS PLANT LEAF DATASETS SUCH AS FLAVIA, SWEDISH, ICL, AND FOLIAGE. ACCORDING TO THE OBTAINED PERFORMANCE RESULTS, THE CALCULATED ACCURACY VALUES FOR FLAVIA, SWEDISH, ICL AND FOLIAGE DATASETS WERE 98.94%, 99.46%, 83.71%, AND 92.92%, RESPECTIVELY.

TREES AND FLOWERY PLANTS CAN BE CLASSIFIED BY USING LEAF RECOGNITION. THIS PAPER PROPOSES A SIMPLE METHOD BASED ON BISECTION OF LEAVES FOR RECOGNITION. AFTER PREPROCESSING TECHNIQUES ARE APPLIED FOR LEAVES, 7 LOW-COST MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES ARE EXTRACTED WHICH ARE USED IN THE LITERATURE. WE PRODUCED 3 ADDITIONAL FEATURES USING HALF LEAF IMAGES. MOST OF LEAF SPECIES HAVE MORPHOLOGICAL STRUCTURE THAT RESEMBLES EACH OTHER A LOT. FOR THESE LEAVES, WHILE STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF ONE HALF RESEMBLE, FEATURES OF OTHER HALF DIFFER. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS KNOWLEDGE, LEAF IS ORIENTED ACCORDING TO ITS MAJOR AXIS AND TWO PARTS ARE ACQUIRED BY SLICING LEAF ON ITS CENTROID VERTICALLY. AREA, EXTENT AND ECCENTRICITY FEATURES ARE EXTRACTED FOR EACH PART AND THEIR PROPORTIONS TO EACH OTHER ARE TAKEN AS NEW FEATURES IN THIS STUDY. THESE ALL 10 FEATURES ARE USED AS AN INPUT TO PROBABILISTIC NEURAL NETWORK (PNN).

"VAGHELA H;RAJA R";COMPARISON OF SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE AND KNEAREST NEIGHBOR CLASSIFIERS FOR TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION;TREE SPECIES ARE A GROUP OF ORGANISMS THAT HAVE DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS, AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF TREE SPECIES HAS BECOME ESSENTIAL TO PROTECT BIODIVERSITY, ECOSYSTEM BALANCING, AS WELL AS FOR MEDICINAL PURPOSES. IT TAKES TOO MUCH TIME FOR EXPERTS TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUAL TREE SPECIES, SO RESEARCH BASED ON AUTOMATIC TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION IS REQUIRED TO SAVE TIME. REMOTE SENSING-BASED SATELLITE IMAGE PROCESSING (IP) TECHNIQUES ARE USEFUL FOR DETECTING FEATURES OF DIFFERENT TREE SPECIES LIKE SHAPE, TEXTURE, COLOR, ETC., BUT IP TECHNIQUES ALONE ARE NOT SUFFICIENT FOR AUTOMATIC DETECTION OF TREE SPECIES. SO, SOME MACHINE LEARNING (ML) ALGORITHMS ARE USEFUL FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF TREE SPECIES. HERE, HISTOGRAM OF ORIENTED GRADIENT (HOG) FEATURES HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENT TREE SPECIES LIKE, BANANA, COCONUT, LEMON, MANGO, OIL PALM, PAPAYA TREES, AND THOSE WHICH DO NOT BELONG TO ANY CATEGORY, ARE RECOGNIZED AS A NOT SPECIFIED CLASS. SO, THE COMBINATION OF IP AND ML TECHNIQUES ARE USEFUL. HERE, COMPARISON OF K-NEAREST-NEIGHBOR (KNN) AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) CLASSIFIERS WITH HOG HAS BEEN INTRODUCED, AND OVERALL ACCURACY (OA) FOR KNN AND SVM CAN BE OBTAINED 85.71% AND 93.33% RESPECTIVELY.

"VALLIAMMAL N;GEETHALAKSHMI S";MULTIPLE NOISE REDUCTION USING HYBRID METHOD FOR LEAF RECOGNITION;PLANT RECOGNITION IS VERY DEMANDING IN BIOLOGY AND AGRICULTURE AS NEW PLANT DISCOVERY AND THE COMPUTERIZATION OF THE MANAGEMENT OF PLANT SPECIES BECOME MORE POPULAR. DEVELOPING AN AUTOMATIC PLANT RECOGNITION SYSTEM BECOMES A VERY CHALLENGING TASK. IMAGE PRE-PROCESSING TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FILTERING FOR NOISE REDUCTION AND ENHANCEMENT OF THE IMAGE IS HIGHLY ESSENTIAL. THE COMPUTERIZED PLANT RECOGNITION MAINLY SUPPRESSES NOISE IN THE INPUT IMAGE LEADING TO STABLE FEATURE EXTRACTION OF PLANTS. BY APPLYING GAUSSIAN NOISE, THE LEAF IMAGE APPEARS BLURRED, DUE TO WHICH THE EDGES OF THE LEAF VEIN IS NOT CLEARLY VISIBLE. SPECKLE NOISE OCCURRENCE IS OFTEN UNDESIRABLE, AND ALSO VERY DANGEROUSLY CAUSES DAMAGE TO THE LEAF SHAPE AND STRUCTURE. SO, THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM WHERE BOTH MULTIPLE GAUSSIAN AND SPECKLE NOISE CAN BE REMOVED AND RESTORED SO THAT THE IMAGE BECOMES NOISE FREE AND PRODUCES CLEAR VEIN AND SHAPE OF THE LEAF WHICH IS HIGHLY ESSENTIAL FOR FURTHER PROCESS. HYBRID FILTER METHOD IS DEVELOPED TO REMOVE THE NOISE, ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF IMAGE AND THEREBY PRODUCES BETTER RESULTS COMPARED TO OTHER TRADITIONAL FILTERS.

"NAKARMI A;TANG L";INTERPLANT SPACING SENSING AT EARLY GROWTH STAGES USING A TIMEOFFLIGHT OF LIGHT BASED 3D VISION SENSOR;UNIFORM PLANT SPACING IS ALWAYS DESIRED FOR EQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF WATER AND NUTRIENTS AMONG PLANTS. RESEARCHERS IN THE PAST HAVE SHOWN THAT VARIATIONS IN PLANT SPACING RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT VARIATION IN FINAL CROP YIELDS. PLANTER MANUFACTURERS AND RESEARCHERS HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY TO DEVELOP COMPUTER VISION-BASED AUTOMATIC INTERPLANT SPACING SENSING SYSTEMS. CURRENT SYSTEMS MOSTLY UTILIZE TOP-VIEW IMAGES USING A STEREO RIG, OR A VIDEO CAMERA. THESE SYSTEMS ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO COLOR VARIATIONS INTRODUCED BY SHADOW FORMATIONS AND GLARES AND HAVE DIFFICULTIES WHEN PLANT CANOPIES START OCCLUDING. WE DEVELOPED AN INTERPLANT SPACING SENSING SYSTEM USING A TIME-OF-FLIGHT (TOF) BASED 3D VISION SENSOR. THE CAMERA WAS CAPABLE OF CAPTURING DEPTH AND INTENSITY DATA WITH ONE SINGLE SHOT. THE DEPTH IMAGES CAPTURED FROM THE SIDE WERE STITCHED TOGETHER USING DISTANCE INFORMATION FROM A WHEEL ENCODER IN CONJUNCTION WITH A FEATURE-BASED IMAGE SEQUENCING PROCESS. MULTIPLE LAYERS OF IMAGE DATA WERE USED FOR STEM LOCATION IDENTIFICATION. THE USE OF DEPTH IMAGES MADE THE PLANT IDENTIFICATION LESS SENSITIVE TO COLOR VARIATIONS. A COVERED VEHICLE WAS DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE SUNLIGHT FROM DIRECTLY SHEDDING ON THE PLANTS AND TO REDUCE THE INTERFERENCE FROM WIND, WHICH IN TURN MADE THE SYSTEM USABLE THROUGHOUT THE DAY. THE VERTICAL CAMERA POSITION WAS EASILY ADJUSTABLE TO WORK WITH DIFFERENT GROWTH STAGES OF THE CROPS. THE USE OF SIDE-VIEW IMAGES MADE THE SYSTEM CAPABLE TO DETECTING INCLINED PLANTS AND THEREFORE, BOOSTED THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SYSTEM IN PRECISELY LOCATING THE STEM CENTERS, AND THEREBY MINIMIZED THE MEASUREMENT ERRORS. BASED ON THE INITIAL TRIALS ON CORN PLANTS OF GROWTH STAGES V3-V6, THE SYSTEM HAS ACHIEVED 100% PLANT IDENTIFICATION ACCURACY WITH A RSME OF 0.15 CM FOR INTER-PLANT SPACING MEASUREMENTS.;"3D VISION; EARLY GROWTH STAGES; IMAGE PROCESSING; SPACING SENSING; TIME-OF-FLIGHT";"CAMERAS; COMPUTER VISION; CROPS; ENGINEERS; IMAGING SYSTEMS; LOCATION; MEASUREMENT ERRORS; SENSORS; VIDEO CAMERAS; 3-D VISION; 3D VISION SENSOR; CAMERA POSITIONS; COLOR VARIATIONS; CORN PLANT; CROP YIELD; CURRENT SYSTEM; DEPTH IMAGE; DISTANCE INFORMATION; DISTRIBUTION OF WATER; EARLY GROWTH; EARLY GROWTH STAGES; FEATURE-BASED; GROWTH STAGES; HIGHLY SENSITIVE; IMAGE DATA; IMAGE SEQUENCING; INTENSITY DATA; LOCATION IDENTIFICATION; MULTIPLE LAYERS; PLANT CANOPIES; PLANT IDENTIFICATION; PLANT SPACING; SENSING SYSTEMS; SINGLE SHOTS; SPACING SENSING; STEREO RIGS; TIME OF FLIGHT; WHEEL ENCODERS; THREE DIMENSIONAL";AMERICAN SOCIETY OF AGRICULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERS ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL MEETING 2010, ASABE 2010;1;2010;ENGLISH;CONFERENCE PAPER;NA

SINCE, SOME CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS COLOUR, MORPHOLOGY AND TEXTURE SHOW THE DIFFERENCE OF OBJECTS. THEREFORE, IT IS NECESSARY THAT THESE PARAMETERS SHOULD BE USED BY MACHINE VISION FOR REORGANIZATION OF DIFFERENT OBJECTS FROM EACH OTHER. IN THIS STUDY, IDENTIFICATION OF FOUR MAJOR WEED SEEDS (COMMON VETCH, CLEAVERS, CORNFLOWER AND GREAT BUR-PARSLEY), THAT ARE WIDELY FOUND IN FARMS OF WEST AND NORTH WEST OF IRAN, WAS DONE BY DIGITAL IMAGE ANALYSIS. RECOGNIZING AND REMOVING THE WEED SEEDS FROM THE MAIN PRODUCT IS VERY IMPORTANT. BY RECOGNIZING THE WEED SEED SPECIES FROM EACH OTHER, IT IS POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE PERCENTAGE OF FARM POLLUTION TO EACH OF WEED SEEDS, AND THEN WEED CONTROL OPERATIONS WILL BE APPLIED. THE VALUE OF PRODUCTS IS DETERMINED THROUGH RATIO OF WEED SEEDS WEIGHT TO TOTAL WEIGHT. THEREFORE, RECOGNITION OF WEED SEED SPECIES AS THE FIRST STEP IN DETERMINATION OF PRODUCTS VALUE IS VERY IMPORTANT. FOR THIS PURPOSE, BY USING A CHAMBER OF IMAGING, SOME UNIFORM IMAGES OF SAMPLES WERE ACQUIRED. THEN, A PROGRAM WAS CODED IN MATLAB SOFTWARE FOR SEGMENTATION OF THE SAMPLES. RECOGNITION OF WEED SEEDS WAS BASED ON MORPHOLOGY AND COLOUR. FOR RECOGNIZING COMMON VETCH, GREAT BUR-PARSLEY AND CORNFLOWER COLOUR FEATURES DEFINED IN RGB AND HSI COLOUR MODELS WERE USED. THESE COLOUR FEATURES WERE MEAN (RED), MEAN AND VARIANCE OF SATURATION COMPONENT. RECOGNITION OF CLEAVERS WAS DONE BY TWO MORPHOLOGY FEATURES, SHAPE FACTOR 1 AND SHAPE FACTOR 2.

THESE FUZZY SETS ARE THEN CONJUNCTED TO FORM ANTECEDENTS AND CONSEQUENCES, WHICH ARE SUBSEQUENTLY ASSOCIATED TO FORM IF-THEN RULES. THE ASSOCIATIVE MEMORY IS ENCODED THROUGH AN OFFLINE BATCH MODE LEARNING PROCESS CONSISTING OF THREE CONSECUTIVE PHASES.

FOR THIS TASK A KEY ENABLER IS A ROBUST DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF THE PLANT AND SPECIES. AUTOMATICALLY DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN PLANT SPECIES IS A CHALLENGING TASK, BECAUSE SOME SPECIES LOOK VERY SIMILAR. IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO TRANSLATE THE SYMBOLIC HIGH LEVEL DESCRIPTION OF THE APPEARANCES AND THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PLANTS USED BY HUMANS, INTO A FORMAL, COMPUTER UNDERSTANDABLE FORM. ALSO IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO RELIABLY DETECT STRUCTURES, LIKE LEAVES AND BRANCHES IN 3D DATA PROVIDED BY OUR SENSOR. ONE APPROACH TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IS TO LEARN HOW TO CLASSIFY THE SPECIES BY USING A SET OF EXAMPLE PLANTS AND MACHINE LEARNING METHODS. IN THIS PAPER WE ARE INTRODUCING A METHOD FOR DISTINGUISHING PLANT SPECIES USING A 3D LIDAR SENSOR AND SUPERVISED LEARNING. FOR THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED A SET OF SIZE AND ROTATION INVARIANT FEATURES AND EVALUATED EXPERIMENTALLY WHICH ARE THE MOST DESCRIPTIVE ONES. BESIDES THESE FEATURES WE HAVE ALSO COMPARED DIFFERENT LEARNING METHODS USING THE TOOLBOX WEKA. IT TURNED OUT THAT THE BEST METHODS FOR OUR APPLICATION ARE SIMPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION FUNCTIONS, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES AND NEURAL NETWORKS.

MEDICINAL PLANTS HAVE DIVERSE TYPES THAT CAUSING MODERN SOCIETY HAVE DIFFICULTY IN RECOGNIZING THESE CROPS. MEDICINAL PLANTS GENERALLY CAN BE IDENTIFIED BY THE LEAVES, STEMS AND FRUIT. ONE OF THE LEAVES CHARACTERISTICS CAN BE DISTINGUISHED BASED ON VEIN STRUCTURE AND SHAPE OF ITS. BASED ON THESE PROBLEM, PLANT RECOGNITION BASED ON VEIN AND SHAPE ARE MADE BY USING LOCALIZED ARC PATTERN METHOD. THERE ARE TWO IMPORTANT PROCESSES IN PLANT RECOGNITION APPLICATIONS. FIRST PROCESS IS ENROLLMENT AND THE SECOND IS RECOGNITION PROCESS. IN THE ENROLMENT PROCESS, THE LEAVES IMAGE FILED AS MANY AS 6 IMAGES FOR EACH LEAVES TYPE. THIS IMAGE THEN CALCULATED BASED ON THE 42 SPECIAL MODEL PATTERN OBTAINED AND THE FEATURE IS STORED AS A REFERENCE IMAGE. LEAVES IMAGES THAT USED AS TEST IMAGE ARE 200 IMAGES. ON THE RECOGNITION PROCESS, THE TEST IMAGE WILL BE PROCESS WHICH AS SAME AS AT ENROLLMENT PROCESS, HOWEVER FEATURE FROM THE TEST IMAGE WILL BE COMPARING WITH REFERENCE IMAGE IN DATABASE, THEN IT CALCULATE THE DIFFERENCE VALUE. THIS PROCESS USES A THRESHOLD VALUE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE TEST IMAGES LEAVES ARE RECOGNIZED OR NOT.

"SIEMENS M;HERBON R;GAYLER R;NOLTE K;BROOKS D";AUTOMATED MACHINE FOR THINNING LETTUCE DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION;DESPITE THE TREMENDOUS ADVANCES MADE IN AGRICULTURAL MECHANIZATION, THE PRECISE TASK OF THINNING LETTUCE SEEDLINGS IS STILL PERFORMED BY CREWS OF WORKERS USING HAND HOES IN COMMERCIAL FIELD PRODUCTION. FINDING LABORERS TO PERFORM THIS PHYSICALLY DEMANDING WORK IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROJECT WERE TO 1) DEVELOP AN AUTOMATED MACHINE FOR THINNING LETTUCE TO IMPROVE LABOR RESOURCE USE EFFICIENCY AND 2) EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MACHINE AS COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL METHODS. THE PROTOTYPE MACHINE WAS DEVELOPED TO THIN LETTUCE SEEDLINGS NOMINALLY PLANTED 2 INCHES APART TO THE DESIRED FINAL PLANT SPACING OF 10-11 INCHES. THE DEVICE IS PRINCIPALLY COMPRISED OF A MACHINE VISION SYSTEM FOR DETECTING LETTUCE SEEDLINGS AND THEIR LOCATION AND A SYSTEM FOR INTERMITTENTLY DELIVERING AN HERBICIDAL SPRAY TO KILL PLANTS. WHEN TESTED AT A TRAVEL SPEED OF 1.5 MPH, AUTOMATED MACHINE THINNING PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF PLANT SPACING, PLANT SPACING UNIFORMITY, NUMBER OF LIVE PLANTS PER ACRE AND TIME REQUIRED FOR A HAND LABORER TO REMOVE PLANTS MISSED DURING THINNING WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM HAND THINNING WHEN PLANTS WERE THINNED USING SULFURIC ACID (10% V/V), PARAQUAT (1.3 PT A.I./ACRE) OR VINEGAR (20% V/V) (P = 0.05). AUTOMATED MACHINE THINNING PERFORMANCE AFTER HAND WEEDING WAS ALSO NOT SIGNIFICANTLY FROM HAND THINNING IN TERMS OF PLANT SPACING, COV IN PLANT SPACING AND PLANT STAND WHEN PLANTS WERE SPRAYED WITH ANY OF THE FIVE CHEMICALS TESTED. BASED ON THESE RESULTS, IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE AUTOMATED MACHINE WAS ABLE TO RELIABLY CONTROL SPRAY DELIVERY SUCH THAT PLANTS WERE SELECTIVELY THINNED TO THE DESIRED FINAL PLANT SPACING. YIELDS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED WHEN PLANTS WERE THINNED USING THE AUTOMATED MACHINE WITH ANY OF THE HERBICIDAL SPRAY SOLUTIONS TESTED INDICATING THAT THE MACHINE WAS ABLE TO DELIVER HERBICIDAL SPRAY WITH SUFFICIENT ACCURACY THAT SEEDLINGS ARE NOT INJURED. FURTHER MACHINE DEVELOPMENT IS NEEDED SO THAT A UNIT MORE SUITABLE FOR COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION CAN BE TESTED ON A LARGE SCALE TO CONFIRM THESE RESULTS AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER SUCH A SYSTEM IS VIABLE FOR USE IN COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION.;"AUTOMATED; LETTUCE; MACHINE; MACHINE VISION; PERFORMANCE TESTING; PLANT RECOGNITION; PRECISION; SEEDLINGS; THINNING";"ACETIC ACID; AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY; AGRICULTURE; AUTOMATION; COMPUTER VISION; SULFURIC ACID; AUTOMATED; LETTUCE; MACHINE; PERFORMANCE TESTING; PLANT RECOGNITION; PRECISION; SEEDLINGS; THINNING; SEED";AMERICAN SOCIETY OF AGRICULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERS ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL MEETING 2012, ASABE 2012;2;2012;ENGLISH;CONFERENCE PAPER;NA
"WU H;LIU J;LI P;WEN Z";LEAF RECOGNITION BASED ON BINARY GABOR PATTERN AND EXTREME LEARNING MACHINE;AUTOMATIC PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION HAS BEEN A HOT RESEARCH SPOT IN THE RECENT YEARS, WHERE ENCOURAGING IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED IN BOTH RECOGNITION ACCURACY AND SPEED. HOWEVER, EXISTING ALGORITHMS USUALLY ONLY EXTRACTED LEAF FEATURES (SUCH AS SHAPE OR TEXTURE) OR MERELY ADOPT TRADITIONAL NEURAL NETWORK ALGORITHM TO RECOGNIZE LEAF, WHICH STILL SHOWED LIMITATION IN RECOGNITION ACCURACY AND SPEED ESPECIALLY WHEN FACING A LARGE LEAF DATABASE. IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT A NOVEL METHOD FOR LEAF RECOGNITION BY COMBINING FEATURE EXTRACTION AND MACHINE LEARNING. TO BREAK THE WEAKNESS EXPOSED IN THE TRADITIONAL ALGORITHMS, WE APPLIED BINARY GABOR PATTERN (BGP) AND EXTREME LEARNING MACHINE (ELM) TO RECOGNIZE LEAVES. TO ACCELERATE THE LEAF RECOGNITION, WE ALSO EXTRACT BGP FEATURES FROM LEAF IMAGES WITH AN OFFLINE MANNER. DIFFERENT FROM THE TRADITIONAL NEURAL NETWORK LIKE BP AND SVM, OUR METHOD BASED ON THE ELM ONLY REQUIRES SETTING ONE PARAMETER, AND WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FINE-TUNING DURING THE LEAF RECOGNITION. OUR METHOD IS EVALUATED ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT DATABASES WITH DIFFERENT SCALES. COMPARISONS WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS WERE ALSO CONDUCTED TO EVALUATE THE COMBINATION OF BGP AND ELM.

INFORMATION ABOUT NUTRIENT DEFICIENCIES IN CROPS GROWN IN CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT IS ESSENTIAL TO OPTIMIZE FOOD PRODUCTIVITY. IN THIS STUDY, NEAR INFRARED REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY (NIRS) ANALYSIS WAS USED TO IDENTIFY NITROGEN (N) DEFICIENCY COUPLED WITH PATTERN RECOGNITION METHODS IN MINI-CUCUMBER PLANTS GROWN UNDER NON-SOIL CONDITIONS. LEAVES AT THE FIRST THREE NODES OF NITROGEN DEFICIENT PLANTS AND CONTROL PLANT WERE USED FOR NIRS DATA ACQUISITION. K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS (KNN) AND ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK (ANN) WERE APPLIED TO BUILD DIAGNOSTICS MODELS, RESPECTIVELY. SOME PARAMETERS OF THE MODEL WERE OPTIMIZED BY CROSS-VALIDATION. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE KNN MODEL AND THE ANN MODEL BASED ON NIRS DATA WAS COMPARED. EXPERIMENT RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE ANN MODEL WAS BETTER THAN THE KNN MODEL. THE OPTIMAL ANN MODEL WAS ACHIEVED WHEN PRINCIPLE COMPONENT FACTORS WERE EQUAL TO 5 AND IDENTIFICATION RATE OF THE ANN MODEL WERE 100% IN BOTH THE TRAINING SET AND THE PREDICTION SET.

"VAN H N;HIEN N";RECOGNITION OF PLANT SPECIES USING DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL FEATURE EXTRACTION;THERE ARE MORE THAN 391,000 PLANT SPECIES CURRENTLY KNOWN TO GLOBAL SCIENCE, AND IT IS CHALLENGING TO DISTINGUISH AMONG THEM. THE IDENTIFICATION OF PLANT SPECIES REQUIRES IN-DEPTH SURVEYORS AND BOTANISTS WHO POSSESS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE ON NATIVE PLANT SPECIES. THEREFORE, PLANT RECOGNITION HAS BECOME AN INTERDISCIPLINARY CONCENTRATION IN BOTH BOTANICAL TAXONOMY AND MACHINE LEARNING FOR A FASTER IDENTIFICATION PROCESS. IN THIS PAPER, A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK SYSTEM HAS BEEN PROPOSED TO PERFORM FEATURE EXTRACTION USING DIFFERENT DEEP LEARNING MODELS IN LARGE-SCALE PLANT CLASSIFICATION METHODS. THE PLANT IMAGE DATASET WAS COLLECTED FROM THE PLANTCLEF2003 DATASET, WHICH CONSISTS OF 51,273 IMAGES FROM 609 PLANT SPECIES. FOUR DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL FEATURE EXTRACTION METHODS, INCLUDING RESNET50V2, INCEPTION RESNET V2, MOBILENETV2, AND VGG16, ARE USED TO EXTRACT FEATURES FROM THE IMAGES. A COMPARATIVE EVALUATION OF FOUR DEEP LEARNING MODELS USING TWO CLASSIFICATION METHODS, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVN) AND K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR (KNN), IS PRESENTED. WITH THE HIGHEST ACCURACY OF 95.6%, MOBILENETV2 PERFORMED BETTER THAN THE OTHER DEEP LEARNING MODELS FOR PLANT RECOGNITION IN BOTH SVM AND KNN CLASSIFICATION METHODS. MOREOVER, THE SVM CLASSIFIER HAS OUTPERFORMED THE KNN IN TERMS OF ACCURACY IN THE PLANT IMAGE RECOGNITION SYSTEM. THE OUTCOMES ARE PROMISING FOR FURTHER APPLICATIONS AND FUTURE WORK GEARS TOWARDS EXPERIMENTS ON A LARGER DATASET WITH HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING FACILITIES TO PROPOSE A HIGHER ACCURACY SYSTEM OF PLANT IMAGE IDENTIFICATION IN NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS.

"YUSOF R;KHAIRUDDIN U;KHALID M";A NEW MUTATION OPERATION FOR FASTER CONVERGENCE IN GENETIC ALGORITHM FEATURE SELECTION;FEATURE SELECTION IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN DATA CLASSIFICATION BECAUSE IT HAS A HIGH IMPACT ON CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY. FEATURE SELECTION USING GENETIC ALGORITHM (GA) IS USUALLY DONE IN A WRAPPER METHOD. THE PROCESS IS TIME CONSUMING ESPECIALLY FOR LARGE DIMENSIONAL DATABASE. WE PROPOSE A NEW MUTATION OPERATION FOR FASTER FEATURE SELECTION BY GA BASED ON ELITISM OF THE ALLELE. NORMAL ELITISM IN GA PRESERVES THE MOST FIT CHROMOSOMES WHICH ARE EVALUATED USING THE FITNESS FUNCTION. IN THE SAME WAY, THE HIGHEST FIT ALLELE WILL BE PRESERVED AND THE FITNESS OF THE ALLELE IS EVALUATED BASED ON THE FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCES. THE CHROMOSOME UNDERGOING THIS MUTATION PROCESS WILL HAVE A HIGH IF NOT THE HIGHEST FITNESS BECAUSE IT IS CREATED BASED ON A HIGH FIT ALLELE. IT WILL BE THE CATALYST TO INCREASE THE RATE OF CONVERGENCE TOWARDS ACHIEVING AN OPTIMAL FEATURES COMBINATION. EXPERIMENTS FOR FEATURE SELECTION USING THIS METHOD ARE CONDUCTED USING A DATABASE OF TROPICAL WOOD SPECIES WHICH HAS A LARGE VARIATION OF FEATURES. RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT A HIGH ACCURACY IS OBTAINED FOR THE RECOGNITION OF THE TROPICAL WOOD SPECIES USING THE FEATURE SELECTION METHOD. IN ADDITION, IT HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN THAT THE CHROMOSOMES CREATED BY THE NEW MUTATION OPERATION HAVE HIGH FITNESS AND THE RATE OF OPTIMAL CONVERGENCE IS IMPROVED SUBSTANTIALLY.

THE SYSTEM CAPTURES IMAGE OF WOOD SURFACE AND FEATURES ARE EXTRACTED FROM THESE IMAGES BEFORE BEING INPUT INTO THE CLASSIFIER. HOWEVER, DUE TO VARIATIONS IN TROPICAL WOOD SPECIES, A SINGLE FEATURE EXTRACTION METHOD CANNOT ACCOMMODATE MULTISPECIES CLASSIFICATION. THEREFORE, WE PROPOSE THE USE OF TWO FEATURE EXTRACTION METHOD WHICH ARE BASIC GREY LEVEL AURA MATRIX (BGLAM) AND STATISTICAL PROPERTIES OF PORES DISTRIBUTION (SPPD). FEATURES FROM BOTH FEATURE EXTRACTORS ARE FUSED TOGETHER. HOWEVER, THE USE OF THE FUSION METHOD RESULTED IN THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF FEATURES FOR CLASSIFICATION. IN ORDER TO ENSURE ONLY FEATURES THAT ARE DISCRIMINATING ENOUGH AS WELL AS REDUCE THE NUMBER OF FEATURES, WE DEVELOPED AN OPTIMIZE FEATURE SELECTION ALGORITHM TO THE FUSED FEATURE SET BY SELECTING ONLY DISCRIMINANT FEATURES TO BE USED FOR CLASSIFICATION. A WRAPPER GENETIC ALGORITHM (GA) IS INTRODUCED INTO THE SYSTEM TO MAKE FEATURE SELECTION AND CLASSIFICATION. LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS (LDA) IS WRAPPED INSIDE GA TO SELECT ONLY DISCRIMINATING AND NON-NOISY FEATURES TO BE SUBSET DATABASE FOR FINAL CLASSIFICATION.

HOWEVER, MOST OF THE PHYSICAL METHODS ARE MANUAL. THEREFORE, DEVELOPMENT OF A ROBOTIC WEEDING SYSTEM IS NECESSARY TO PRACTICE EFFICIENT WEED CONTROL. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEVELOP A PIXEL DISCRIMINANT MODEL FOR IMAGE SEGMENTATION BETWEEN CROP AND WEED USING HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGING. A HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGE WAS PROCESSED PIXEL BY PIXEL. FIRST, EVERY PIXEL SPECTRUM WAS EXTRACTED FROM THE IMAGE. NEXT, EACH PIXEL SPECTRUM WAS CLASSIFIED INTO SOIL AND PLANT. IF THE PIXEL SPECTRUM WAS IDENTIFIED AS PLANT, IT WAS CLASSIFIED INTO CROP AND WEED. IN THE PIXEL DISCRIMINANT MODEL FOR SOIL AND PLANT, SIMPLE NDVI THRESHOLDING WAS EMPLOYED. THE PIXEL DISCRIMINANT MODEL FOR CROP AND WEED CONSISTED OF A NORMALIZER, AN EXPLANATORY VARIABLE GENERATOR AND THE DISCRIMINATOR. DEVELOPMENT OF THE EXPLANATORY VARIABLE GENERATOR WAS TRIED WITH TWO DIFFERENT METHODS (RAW OR PCA). DEVELOPMENT OF DISCRIMINATOR WAS ALSO TRIED WITH TWO DIFFERENT METHODS (LDA OR NN). IN THIS STUDY, FOUR TYPES OF MODELS (RAW-LDA, RAW-NN, PCA-LDA AND PCA-NN) WERE DEVELOPED FOR DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN CROP AND WEED AND VALIDATED. FINALLY, SEGMENTED IMAGES FOR CROP, WEED, AND SOIL WERE GENERATED FROM THE IMAGES BY APPLYING THESE MODELS. PIXEL DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN SOIL AND PLANT WAS PERFORMED WITH HIGH ACCURACY. IN THE PIXEL DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN CROP AND WEED, SUCCESS RATES OF ALL DISCRIMINANT MODELS WERE MORE THAN 85%. AS FOR THE ACCURACY OF THE MODELS, NN MODELS WERE SUPERIOR TO LDA, AND THE PCA METHOD WAS SUPERIOR TO RAW. HOWEVER, WITH RESPECT TO PROCESSING SPEED, THE RAW METHOD WAS SUPERIOR TO PCA.

PREMARATNE U;APPLICATION OF RECTANGULAR FEATURES FOR THE LOCALIZATION OF FERTILE MATERIAL IN PLANT IMAGES;ANALYSIS OF FERTILE MATERIAL SUCH AS FLOWERS AND FRUIT IS A KEY FACTOR IN THE PROPER IDENTIFICATION OF PLANT SPECIES. DESPITE OBJECT RECOGNITION BEING A MATURE RESEARCH AREA, THE USE OF IT IN AUTOMATED PLANT IDENTIFICATION IS STILL RELATIVELY NEW. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES A NOVEL METHOD OF DETECTING FERTILE MATERIAL IN PLANT IMAGES USING RECTANGULAR FEATURES. RECTANGULAR FEATURES ARE OBTAINED FOR THE GRAYSCALE IMAGE, THE J VALUE IMAGE, THE MAGNITUDE AND ANGLE OF THE GRADIENT OF THE IMAGE. FROM THESE, THE FEATURES WITH THE BEST PERFORMANCE ARE SELECTED BASED ON THEIR ABILITY TO DETECT FERTILE MATERIAL (FLOWERS) AND NON-FERTILE MATERIAL (LEAVES). BASED ON PERFORMANCE, THE RECTANGULAR FEATURES OF THE GRAYSCALE IMAGE AND J VALUE IMAGE ARE USED. MULTIPLE SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) CLASSIFIERS WITH DIFFERENT KERNELS ARE TESTED AND THE FINAL RESULT IS OBTAINED USING CLASSIFIER VOTING BASED ON THE CONFIDENCE OF EACH CLASSIFIER. AFTER APPLYING THE CLASSIFIER TO THE ENTIRE IMAGE, REGIONS OF INTEREST OF FERTILE MATERIAL ARE ISOLATED AND POST PROCESSED.

THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE USE OF THE DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK AS A FEATURE EXTRACTOR TO A PLANT CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM. AN ORIGINAL DATASET CONSISTING OF IMAGES OF SEEDLINGS OF THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT BERRY TREES BELONGING TO THE PHILIPPINE INDIGENOUS PLANTS WAS USED. THE RESULT SHOWS THAT AS THE NETWORK LAYERS ARE GETTING DEEPER, THEY ARE BECOMING BETTER AT EXTRACTING DISCRIMINATIVE FEATURES, SUCH THAT, IRRESPECTIVE OF CLASSIFIER USED THEIR PREDICTION PERFORMANCE KEEPS ON IMPROVING. WHEN THE DIFFERENT LAYERS WERE INDIVIDUALLY VISUALIZED, THE FEATURES EXTRACTED WERE FAR FROM RANDOM, UNINTERPRETABLE PATTERNS. RATHER, THEY SHOW RELEVANT PROPERTIES THAT ARE CAPABLE OF SORTING PATTERNS PROGRESSIVELY FROM LOW TO HIGHER LEVEL.

WE DEVELOPED A NOVEL METHOD FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF CLOSELY RELATED MEDICINAL PLANTS USING A MACHINE LEARNING (ML)-BASED ELECTROCHEMICAL FINGERPRINTING PLATFORM. FIRSTLY, THE SYSTEM FEATURED A BARE GLASSY CARBON ELECTRODE CAPABLE OF RECORDING THE VOLTAMMETRIC RESPONSE OF ACTIVE COMPONENTS IN MEDICINAL PLANTS AS ELECTROCHEMICAL FINGERPRINTS. SUBSEQUENTLY, DIFFERENT ALGORITHMS AND VARIOUS DATASETS WERE EMPLOYED TO ANALYZE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE ABOVE ELECTROCHEMICAL FINGERPRINT DATA AND THE MEDICINAL PLANT SPECIES. AS A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT, 6 SPECIES OF ANOECTOCHILUS ROXBURGHII (A. ROXBURGHII) WERE SELECTED AS THE VERIFICATION SAMPLES. THE ELECTROCHEMICAL FINGERPRINTS OF THE SAMPLES WERE MEASURED BY DIFFERENTIAL PULSE VOLTAMMETRY IN TWO BUFFER SOLUTIONS. THEREAFTER, FOUR POWERFUL ML ALGORITHMS WERE UTILIZED FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF A. ROXBURGHII WITH DIFFERENT DATASETS. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE ACCURACY OF IDENTIFYING SPECIES REACHED 94.4 % BY THE NONLINEAR SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES BASED ON THE SLOPE DATA OF ELECTROCHEMICAL RESPONSES IN TWO BUFFER SOLUTIONS, EVIDENCING THE SUCCESSFUL DISCRIMINATION OF CLOSELY RELATED MEDICAL PLANTS BY THIS METHOD.

IDENTIFYING MANGROVE PLANT SPECIES IS CRITICAL FOR BIODIVERSITY ASSESSMENT, RESTORATION, OR CONSERVATION PROGRAMS APART FROM ECOSYSTEM PROTECTION FROM ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES. YET, COMPREHENSIVE DATA FOR MANAGING COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS SUSTAINABLY ARE BEING GATHERED MANUALLY. FURTHERMORE, IDENTIFYING MANGROVE SPECIES BY TRADITIONAL KEYS IS COMPLICATED, TIME-CONSUMING, AND FRUSTRATING DUE TO TECHNICAL TERMINOLOGY FOR NON-EXPERTS. THE GROWING NEED TO IDENTIFY MANGROVES IN A TIMELY AND COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER MOTIVATES OUR STUDY TO CREATE AN AUTOMATED APPROACH FOR CLASSIFYING THE SPECIES FROM IMAGES OF MANGROVE LEAVES. RECENT ADVANCES IN DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS HAVE RESULTED IN STUDIES DEMONSTRATING EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE IDENTIFICATION TASKS FOR PLANT SPECIES. THIS PAPER EXAMINES EXISTING DEEP NEURAL NETWORK-BASED MACHINE LEARNING APPLICATIONS FOR IDENTIFYING PLANTS DESIGNED FOR HAND-HELD DEVICE USAGE. DRIVEN BY LOW-COST COMPUTATION, SIZE, AND TIME REQUIREMENTS, WE PROPOSE THE USE OF MOBILENET ARCHITECTURE AND TRANSFER LEARNING FOR LEAF-BASED PLANT RECOGNITION.

ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY IMAGES, EACH CLASS ONLY INCLUDES 36 IMAGES AROUND ON AVERAGE AND THUS IT CAN BE REGARDED AS A FEW-SHOT IMAGE CLASSIFICATION. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, TRANSFER LEARNING IS VALIDATED TO BE USEFUL IN MANY SCENARIOS AND A POPULAR STRATEGY IS EMPLOYING A CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) PRETRAINED IN A SUPERVISED MANNER. BUT INSPIRED BY THE LITERATURE ON COMPUTER VISION, WE INSTEAD LEVERAGE A SELF-SUPERVISED VISION TRANSFORMER (VIT) AND SECURE THE FIRST PLACE WITH MA-MRR 0.62692, 0.019 HIGHER THAN THE SECOND PLACE, AND 0.116 THAN THE THIRD. FURTHERMORE, WE ACHIEVE 0.64079 IF TRAINING THE MODEL TWENTY EPOCHS LONGER. COMPARED TO THE POPULAR STRATEGY WITH CNN, SELF-SUPERVISED VIT HAS TWO ADVANTAGES. FIRST, VIT DOES NOT EMBRACE ANY INDUCTIVE BIAS, SUCH AS TRANSLATING INVARIANCE EMBRACED IN CNN, AND THUS OWNS A MORE POWERFUL MODEL CAPACITY. SECOND, SELF-SUPERVISED PRETRAINING OBTAINS A TASK-AGNOSTIC FEATURE EXTRACTOR THAT MAY BE BETTER FOR THE DOWNSTREAM TASK. TO BE MORE SPECIFIC, A RECENTLY PROPOSED SELF-SUPERVISED VIT MODEL PRETRAINED IN IMAGENET, MASKED AUTOENCODER (MAE), IS FINETUNED IN PLANTCLEF2022 DATASET AND THEN TESTED TO REPORT THE EVALUATION. EXCEPT FOR THE CHALLENGE, WE DISCUSS ITS POSSIBLE IMPACTS, SUCH AS TAKING THE DATASET TO PRETRAIN A MODEL FOR PLANT-RELATED TASKS. ESPECIALLY, OUR PRELIMINARY RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE PRETRAINED MODEL IN PLANTCLEF2022 ESSENTIALLY CONTRIBUTES TO IMAGE-BASED PLANT DISEASE RECOGNITION ON SEVERAL PUBLIC DATASETS.

WE THEN USE TRIANGLE FEATURES TO DESCRIBE THE LEAF CONTOUR, WHICH WE CALL THE CONTOUR POINT BASED ON TRIANGLE FEATURES (CPTFS). THE INTERNAL INFORMATION OF THE LEAF IMAGE IS BASED ON SALIENT POINT TRIANGLE FEATURES (SPTFS). THE THIRD STEP IS TO APPLY THE FISHER VECTOR TO ENCODE THE TWO KINDS OF POINT-BASED LOCAL TRIANGLE FEATURES INTO THE HTSD. FINALLY, WE EMPLOY THE SIMPLE EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE TO CALCULATE THE DISSIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE HTSD CHARACTERISTICS OF LEAF IMAGES. WE HAVE EXTENSIVELY EVALUATED THE PROPOSED APPROACH ON SEVERAL PUBLIC LEAF DATASETS SUCCESSFULLY. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT OUR METHOD HAS SUPERIOR RECOGNITION ACCURACY, OUTPERFORMING CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART SHAPE-BASED AND DEEP-LEARNING PLANT IDENTIFICATION APPROACHES.

"YANG C;WEI H";PLANT SPECIES RECOGNITION USING TRIANGLEDISTANCE REPRESENTATION;PLANT SPECIES RECOGNITION USING LEAF IMAGES IS A HIGHLY IMPORTANT AND CHALLENGING ISSUE IN BOTANY AND PATTERN RECOGNITION. A CENTER PROBLEM OF THIS TASK IS HOW TO ACCURATELY EXTRACT LEAF IMAGE CHARACTERISTICS AND QUICKLY CALCULATE THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN THEM. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A NEW SHAPE DESCRIPTION APPROACH CALLED TRIANGLE-DISTANCE REPRESENTATION (TDR) FOR PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION. THE TDR DESCRIPTOR IS REPRESENTED BY TWO MATRICES: A SIGN MATRIX AND A TRIANGLE CENTER DISTANCE MATRIX. THE SIGN MATRIX IS USED TO CHARACTERIZE THE CONVEX/CONCAVE PROPERTY OF A SHAPE CONTOUR, WHILE THE TRIANGLE CENTER DISTANCE MATRIX IS USED TO REPRESENT THE BENDING DEGREE AND SPATIAL INFORMATION OF A SHAPE CONTOUR. THIS METHOD CAN EFFECTIVELY CAPTURE THE DETAILED AND GLOBAL CHARACTERISTICS OF A LEAF SHAPE WHILE KEEPING THE SIMILARITY TRANSFORMATIONS (TRANSLATION, ROTATION, AND SCALING) UNCHANGED. IN ADDITION, THIS METHOD IS QUITE COMPACT AND HAS LOW COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY. WE TESTED OUR METHOD ON FOUR STANDARD PLANT LEAF DATASETS, INCLUDING THE FAMOUS SWEDISH, SMITHSONIAN, FLAVIA, AND IMAGECLEF2012 DATASETS. THE RESULTS CONFIRM THAT OUR APPROACH EXCEEDS THE PRIOR STATE-OF-THE-ART SHAPE-BASED PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION APPROACHES. AN EXTRA EXPERIMENT ON THE MPEG-7 SHAPE DATASET FURTHER SHOWS THAT OUR METHOD CAN BE APPLIED TO GENERAL SHAPE RECOGNITION.

"WANG X;LIANG J;GUO F";FEATURE EXTRACTION ALGORITHM BASED ON DUALSCALE DECOMPOSITION AND LOCAL BINARY DESCRIPTORS FOR PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION;PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION IS VERY IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY TO AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION AND ECOLOGICAL PROTECTION. UNFORTUNATELY, THE ROBUSTNESS AND DISCRIMINABILITY OF THE EXISTING METHODS ARE INSUFFICIENT. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES A NOVEL PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION METHOD. IN ORDER TO EXTRACT DISTINCTIVE FEATURES FROM PLANT LEAF IMAGES AND REDUCE THE PROBABILITY OF DISRUPTION BY OCCLUSION, CLUTTER, OR NOISE, A NOVEL FEATURE EXTRACTION ALGORITHM BASED ON DUAL-SCALE DECOMPOSITION AND LOCAL BINARY DESCRIPTORS IS PROPOSED. THE DUAL-SCALE DECOMPOSITION CONSISTS OF TWO PHASES. IN THE FIRST PHASE, A PLANT LEAF IMAGE IS DECOMPOSED INTO SEVERAL SUBBANDS WITH AN ADAPTIVE LIFTING WAVELET SCHEME. IN THE SECOND PHASE, EACH SUBBAND IS FILTERED USING A GROUP OF VARIABLE-SCALE GAUSSIAN FILTERS. LOCAL BINARY DESCRIPTORS ARE EXTRACTED FROM THE FILTERED SUBBANDS TO CAPTURE BOTH SHAPE AND TEXTURE CHARACTERISTICS, AND THEN THE HISTOGRAMS OF THE LOCAL BINARY DESCRIPTORS AT DIFFERENT SCALES AND DIFFERENT SUBBANDS ARE DETERMINED AND REGARDED AS FEATURES. IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE ROBUSTNESS AND DISCRIMINABILITY OF PLANT LEAF RECOGNITION FURTHER, A FUZZY K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS' CLASSIFIER IS INTRODUCED FOR MATCHING. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED APPROACH YIELDS A BETTER PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF THE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACIES COMPARED WITH THE STATE OF THE ART METHODS. IT IS ALSO SHOWN THAT THIS METHOD IS RELATIVELY ROBUST TO NOISE, OCCLUSION AND SMOOTHING.

"YANG C;PRASHER S;LANDRY J";APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS TO PLANT RECOGNITION IN THE FIELD;"THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT WAS TO DEVELOP A WEED RECOGNITION SYSTEM TO ASSIST IN THE PRECISION APPLICATION OF HERBICIDES IN CORN FIELDS. DIGITAL IMAGES WERE COLLECTED IN MAY, 1998 USING A COMMERCIALLY-AVAILABLE DIGITAL CAMERA. THE INTENSITIES OF THE THREE PRIMARY COLORS, RED, GREEN AND BLUE, WERE COMPARED FOR EACH PIXEL OF THE IMAGES. THE COLOR OF A PIXEL WAS LEFT UNCHANGED IF THE GREEN INTENSITY WAS GREATER THAN EACH OF THE OTHER TWO; OTHERWISE THE THREE INTENSITIES WERE SET TO ZERO. BACKGROUND OBJECTS WERE THUS REMOVED FROM THE IMAGES. THE RESULTING PIXEL INTENSITIES OF THE MODIFIED IMAGES WERE USED AS THE INPUTS FOR ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS (ANNS). LEARNING VECTOR QUANTIZATION (LVQ) ANNS WERE USED TO DISTINGUISH CORN FROM WEEDS, AS WELL AS TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN WEED SPECIES. THE SUCCESS RATE FOR A SINGLE ANN IN DISTINGUISHING A GIVEN WEED SPECIES FROM CORN WAS AS HIGH AS 90%, AND AS HIGH AS 80% IN DISTINGUISHING ANY OF SEVERAL WEED SPECIES FROM CORN. BETTER SUCCESS RATE MIGHT BE OBTAINABLE WITH MORE ELABORATE SCHEMES FOR DATA INPUT, AND/OR STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS SUCH AS CASCADING. THE IMAGE-PROCESSING TIME FOR THE ANNS WAS AS SHORT AS 0.48 S PER IMAGE, THUS MAKING IT USEFUL FOR REAL-TIME DATA PROCESSING AND APPLICATION OF HERBICIDES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH ANNS FOR WEED RECOGNITION COULD BE USEFUL IN PRECISION FARMING, TO GUIDE SITE-SPECIFIC HERBICIDE APPLICATION.

THE ROI TECHNIQUE CREATES IMAGE SUBSETS BY SELECTING REGIONS OF THE DISPLAYED IMAGE. THE ROIS ARE TYPICALLY USED TO EXTRACT STATISTICS FOR IMAGE OPERATIONS SUCH AS CLASSIFICATION. AS SUCH, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO PRESENT A NOVEL APPLICATION OF CURVE DETECTION FEATURE EXTRACTION TECHNIQUE IN WEED CLASSIFICATION.

HOWEVER, DUE TO THE LIMITATION OF ECOSYSTEM COMPLEXITY AND THE FREQUENT CLOUDY WEATHER, IT REMAINS CHALLENGING TO OBTAIN DETAILED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE VARIETIES IN SUBTROPICAL AREAS. IN THIS STUDY, 18 SCENES OF GAOFEN-6 (GF6) AND 13 SCENES OF SENTINEL-2 (S2) IMAGES WERE HARMONIZED USING LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS, AND THE IDENTIFICATION ABILITIES OF 23 RED-EDGE VEGETATION INDEX (REVI) TIME-SERIES AND THE NORMALIZED DIFFERENCE VEGETATION INDEX (NDVI) TIME-SERIES WERE EVALUATED USING THE RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER (RF). THE FEATURE REDUCTION METHODS WERE EMPLOYED TO BOOST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INPUT FEATURES, AND THE OPTIMAL RED-EDGE COMBINATION CONSISTING OF SPECTRAL AND TEXTURAL FEATURES WAS BUILT TO MAP THE DOMINANT TREE SPECIES PRECISELY IN SOUTHEAST CHINA. OUR RESULTS SHOWED AS FOLLOWS: (1) GF6 AND S2 COULD BE HARMONIZED WITH A MEAN COEFFICIENT OF DETERMINATION (R2) GREATER THAN 0.94 AND THE ROOT MEANS SQUARED ERROR (RMSE) LESS THAN 0.02, WHICH WAS HELPFUL TO IMPROVE THE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN MULTI-SOURCE REMOTE SENSING DATA AND SUBSEQUENTLY DERIVED PRODUCTS. (2) MOST OF THE REVI TIME-SERIES PERFORMED BETTER THAN NDVI TIME-SERIES, AND THE TRANSFORMED CHLOROPHYLL ABSORPTION RATIO INDEXES (TCARI2) GOT THE HIGHEST OVERALL ACCURACY OF 86.28%, WHICH COULD BE FURTHER IMPROVED TO 88.37% BY ADDING 26 TEXTURAL FEATURES. (3) THE PHENOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS FROM DIFFERENT SEASONS WERE CONDUCIVE TO TREE SPECIES CLASSIFICATION COMPARED TO THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT SENSORS, AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF SPRING IMAGES PLAYED THE MOST IMPORTANT ROLE IN RF, FOLLOWED BY AUTUMN AND WINTER, WHILE THE MID-SUMMER IMAGES SEEMED TO BE NEGLIGIBLE IN THE CLASSIFIER.

XU G;EFFECTIVE SCALEGENERATION SCHEME BASED SHAPE DESCRIPTOR FOR FAST LEAF RECOGNITION AND RETRIEVAL;PLANT SPECIES RECOGNITION USING LEAF IMAGES IS A VERY CHALLENGING TASK IN THE FIELD OF PATTERN RECOGNITION. IN THIS PAPER, AN EFFECTIVE SCALE-GENERATION SCHEME IS PROPOSED TO EXTRACT LEAF CONTOUR FEATURES. FOR EACH POINT ON SAMPLED LEAF CONTOUR, THE SCALE-GENERATION SCHEME ITERATIVELY UTILIZED TRISECTIONS OF LEAF CONTOUR TO FIND PAIRED NEIGHBOUR POINTS UNDER DIFFERENT SCALES. THEN PAIRED NEIGHBOUR POINTS UNDER EACH SCALE WERE USED TO EXTRACT ANGLE INFORMATION TO FORM MULTI-SCALE ANGLE REPRESENTATION. SUBSEQUENTLY, FAST FOURIER TRANSFORM WAS APPLIED ON THE MULTI-SCALE ANGLE REPRESENTATION TO MAKE IT COMPACT AND FACILITATE SIMILARITY MEASUREMENT. CITY BLOCK METRIC WAS USED TO COMPUTE SIMILARITY BETWEEN LEAVES FOR RETRIEVAL TASK. BOTH SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE AND 1-NEAREST NEIGHBOUR WERE USED AS CLASSIFIERS FOR RECOGNITION. FINALLY, THE PROPOSED DESCRIPTOR WAS EVALUATED ON FOUR CHALLENGING LEAF DATASETS, INCLUDING SWEDISH, FLAVIA, MEW2012 AND IMAGECLEF 2012 DATASETS. THE RECOGNITION ACCURACY OF THE PROPOSED DESCRIPTOR OVER SWEDISH AND FLAVIA DATASETS REACHES 97.03\% AND 94.03\%, RESPECTIVELY.

TWO VEGETABLE CROPS (CABBAGE AND CARROTS) AND A NUMBER OF NATURALLY OCCURRING WEED SPECIES WERE USED TO DEVELOP THE CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS. CONSIDERING THE ROUGHER ENVIRONMENT, SPECIAL ATTENTION WAS GIVEN TO THE OPEN-FIELD EXPERIMENTS. THE IMAGES WERE OBTAINED WITH A DEVICE THAT PROVIDED CONTROLLED LIGHTING CONDITIONS. THE ANALYSIS WAS CARRIED OUT OFF-LINE. EIGHT DIFFERENT MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES AND THREE COLOUR FEATURES WERE CALCULATED FOR EACH SINGLE OBJECT TO BUILD A JOINT FEATURE SPACE. ON THE BASIS OF SAMPLE DATA SETS OF EACH CLASS, STATISTICS WERE CARRIED OUT TO DETERMINE THE FEATURES, WHICH ARE SUITABLE FOR DISCRIMINATION. A MEMBERSHIP FUNCTION BASED ON A FUZZY LOGIC APPROACH WAS FORMED AND USED FOR THE CLASSIFICATION. THE EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT COLOUR FEATURES CAN HELP TO INCREASE THE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY. MOREOVER, COLOUR WAS USED SUCCESSFULLY FOR THE SEGMENTATION PROCEDURE OF PLANTS AND SOIL. DEPENDING ON GROWTH STAGE, WEED DENSITY AND METHOD OF CALCULATION BETWEEN 51 AND 95% OF THE PLANTS WERE CLASSIFIED CORRECTLY. PROBLEMS STILL EXISTS BY SEPARATING AND ALLOCATING SINGLE PLANTS IN PLANT STANDS WHERE THE PLANTS HAVE GROWN TOGETHER.

THESE INCLUDE TWO MAIN ASPECTS: THE FIRST IS THE ENORMOUS NUMBER AND DIVERSITY OF LEAF SPECIES AND THE SECOND, WHICH IS RELEVANT TO SOME SPECIAL SPECIES, IS THE HIGH INTER-SPECIES AND THE LOW INTRA-SPECIES SIMILARITY. IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT A NOVEL BOUNDARY-BASED APPROACH THAT ATTEMPTS TO OVERCOME THE MOST OF THESE CONSTRAINTS. THIS METHOD HAS BEEN COMPARED TO RESULTS OBTAINED IN THE IMAGE CLEF 2011 PLANT IDENTIFICATION TASK. THE MAIN ADVANTAGE OF THIS FIRST BENCHMARK EDITION IS THAT DIFFERENT IMAGE RETRIEVAL TECHNIQUES WERE TESTED AND A CROWD-SOURCED LEAF DATASET WAS USED.

"YALCIN H;RAZAVI S";PLANT CLASSIFICATION USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS;APPLICATION OF THE BENEFITS OF MODERN COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF AGRICULTURAL FIELDS IS INEVITABLE WITH GROWING CONCERNS ABOUT INCREASING WORLD POPULATION AND LIMITED FOOD RESOURCES. COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY IS CRUCIAL NOT ONLY TO INDUSTRIES RELATED TO FOOD PRODUCTION BUT ALSO TO ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND OTHER RELATED AUTHORITIES. IT IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE THE PRODUCTIVITY, CONTRIBUTE TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AND HEALTHY CROPS, REDUCE THE LABOR COSTS FOR FARMERS AND INCREASE THE OPERATION SPEED AND ACCURACY. IMPLEMENTING MACHINE LEARNING METHODS SUCH AS DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS ON AGRICULTURAL DATA HAS GAINED IMMENSE ATTENTION IN RECENT YEARS. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEMS IS AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION OF PLANT SPECIES BASED ON THEIR TYPES. AUTOMATIC PLANT TYPE IDENTIFICATION PROCESS COULD OFFER A GREAT HELP FOR APPLICATION OF PESTICIDES, FERTILIZATION AND HARVESTING OF DIFFERENT SPECIES ON-TIME IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE PRODUCTION PROCESSES OF FOOD AND DRUG INDUSTRIES. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) ARCHITECTURE TO CLASSIFY THE TYPE OF PLANTS FROM THE IMAGE SEQUENCES COLLECTED FROM SMART AGRO-STATIONS. FIRST CHALLENGES INTRODUCED BY ILLUMINATION CHANGES AND DEBLURRING ARE ELIMINATED WITH SOME PREPROCESSING STEPS. FOLLOWING THE PREPROCESSING STEP, CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE IS EMPLOYED TO EXTRACT THE FEATURES OF IMAGES. THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE CNN ARCHITECTURE AND THE DEPTH OF CNN ARE CRUCIAL POINTS THAT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED SINCE THEY AFFECT THE RECOGNITION CAPABILITY OF THE ARCHITECTURE OF NEURAL NETWORKS. IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE APPROACH PROPOSED IN THIS PAPER, THE RESULTS OBTAINED THROUGH CNN MODEL ARE COMPARED WITH THOSE OBTAINED BY EMPLOYING SVM CLASSIFIER WITH DIFFERENT KERNELS, AS WELL AS FEATURE DESCRIPTORS SUCH AS LBP AND GIST. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE APPROACH IS TESTED ON DATASET COLLECTED THROUGH A GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED PROJECT, TARBIL, FOR WHICH OVER 1200 AGRO-STATIONS ARE PLACED THROUGHOUT TURKEY.

"YUSOF R;ROSLI N";TROPICAL WOOD SPECIES RECOGNITION SYSTEM BASED ON GABOR FILTER AS IMAGE MULTIPLIER;THE MAIN PROBLEM IN WOOD SPECIES RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS THE LACK OF DISCRIMINATIVE FEATURES OF THE TEXTURE IMAGES. SOME OF THE WOOD SPECIES HAVE SIMILAR PATTERNS WITH OTHERS AND SOME HAVE DIFFERENT PATTERNS EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE OF THE SAME SPECIES. MOREOVER, THE GROWTH RINGS FOR TROPICAL WOOD CHANGES SLIGHTLY DUE SEASONAL CHANGES IN CLIMATE. ONE OF THE WAYS TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM IS BY PROVIDING MORE FEATURES REPRESENTATION OF EACH SPECIES. IN THIS WORK, GABOR FILTER IS PROPOSED TO GENERATE MULTIPLE PROCESSED IMAGES FROM A SINGLE IMAGE SO THAT MORE FEATURES CAN BE EXTRACTED AND TRAINED BY THE NEURAL NETWORK. AFTER THE RAW IMAGE HAS BEEN SHARPENED AND CONTRAST ENHANCEMENT HAS BEEN APPLIED AT THE PREPROCESSING STAGE, THE IMAGE WILL BE CONVOLVED WITH GABOR FILTERS. THE OUTPUT OF THE CONVOLUTION GENERATES GABOR IMAGES WHICH ARE IMAGES EXTRACTED BASED ON FREQUENCY AND SPATIAL INFORMATION OF THE ORIGINAL IMAGES. THESE GABOR IMAGES WILL BE USED BY GREY LEVEL CO-OCCURRENCE MATRIX (GLCM) FOR FEATURE EXTRACTION.

CURVATURE WAS USED TO DESCRIBE BOUNDARIES OF BOTH COMPLETELY VISIBLE AND PARTIALLY OCCLUDED LEAVES. COMPLETELY VISIBLE LEAVES WERE IDENTIFIED BY ALIGNING THE CURVATURE FUNCTION OF EACH LEAF WITH THAT OF EACH OF THE MODELS. FUNCTIONS WERE ALIGNED TO MINIMIZE LOCAL DIFFERENCES IN CURVATURE. A FOURIER-MELLIN CORRELATION WAS USED TO CALCULATE SCALE FACTORS FOR RESAMPLING CURVATURE FUNCTIONS OF PARTIALLY OCCLUDED LEAVES. PARTIALLY OCCLUDED LEAVES WERE IDENTIFIED BY ALIGNING THE RESAMPLED CURVATURES WITH EACH OF THE MODELS.

THE MACHINE VISION SYSTEM COULD BE AN ALTERNATIVE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SITE-SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT OF THIS PEST. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK WAS TO DEVELOP AND EVALUATE A MACHINE VISION ALGORITHM FOR IDENTIFYING MAIZE PLANTS ATTACKED BY LESSER CORNSTALK BORER BASED ON COLOUR INFRARED IMAGES. TO DEVELOP THE ALGORITHM, IMAGES OF 40 MAIZE PLANTS WERE TAKEN ON DIFFERENT DAYS AFTER EMERGENCY. THE PLANTS WERE GROWN IN POTS, AND 25 OF THEM WERE INFESTED WITH LESSER CORNSTALK BORER LARVAE AND 15 WERE LEFT HEALTHY. THE ALGORITHM HAD THREE STAGES: LEAF IDENTIFICATION, IMAGE BLOCK CLASSIFICATION, AND PLANT CLASSIFICATION. IN THE LEAF IDENTIFICATION STAGE, THE PLANT LEAVES WERE SEGMENTED BY THRESHOLDING THE NORMALISED DIFFERENCE VEGETATION INDEX IMAGE. FOR THE BLOCK CLASSIFICATION STAGE, DIFFERENT NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURES AND BLOCK SIZES WERE TESTED FOR IDENTIFICATION OF NON-ATTACKED AND ATTACKED PLANT IMAGE BLOCKS. THEN, IN THE PLANT CLASSIFICATION STAGE, DISCRIMINATING FUNCTIONS WERE USED TO CLASSIFY THE SCENE AS EITHER A HEALTHY OR AN ATTACKED PLANT. THE ALGORITHM PERFORMANCE WAS COMPARED WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF FOUR HUMAN EXPERTS BY USING THE KAPPA COEFFICIENT OF AGREEMENT. THE LARGEST SIZE OF IMAGE BLOCK, 9 BY 9 PIXELS, WAS CHOSEN BECAUSE OF ITS LESS COMPUTATIONAL EXIGENCY AND BECAUSE ITS PERFORMANCE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER TESTED BLOCK SIZES. THE ALGORITHM PERFORMANCE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN JUST ONE HUMAN EXPERT. THE KAPPA COEFFICIENTS FOR THE ALGORITHM AND THE THREE BEST HUMAN EXPERTS WERE 63.0 AND 49.7%, RESPECTIVELY.

"ZENG S;ZHANG B;DU Y";JOINT DISTANCES BY SPARSE REPRESENTATION AND LOCALITYCONSTRAINED DICTIONARY LEARNING FOR ROBUST LEAF RECOGNITION;PLANT SPECIES RECOGNITION HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT AND IMPORTANT TASK IN AGRICULTURE, WHERE COMPUTER TECHNIQUES LIKE IMAGE PROCESSING AND PATTERN RECOGNITION CAN COMMENDABLY FACILITATE PLANT RECOGNITION BASED ON LEAF IMAGES. THE LOCALITY-CONSTRAINED MODELS PRODUCED BY SPARSE REPRESENTATION AND DICTIONARY LEARNING ARE A FEW OF THE PREVAILING FEATURE MODELS FOR LEAF IMAGE RECOGNITION. PREVIOUS STUDIES DEMONSTRATED THAT SPARSITY IN REPRESENTATION PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE RECOGNITION, WHILE SPARSITY CONSTRAINTS ARE THE KEYS TO SOLVE THE DICTIONARY LEARNING PROBLEMS. MANY OF THEM FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE SPARSITY, WHICH IS HARD, BUT USING LARGE ATOMS IN DICTIONARY LEARNING FOR HIGH ACCURACY CONSUMED MORE TRAINING TIME. ACTUALLY, SPARSE REPRESENTATION AND DICTIONARY LEARNING ARE BOTH BASED ON DISTANCE CALCULATION, E.G., EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE, WHICH IS ALSO AN ASPECT POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN AN IMPROVEMENT. ON THE PREMISE OF UNCHANGED SPARSITY, THIS PAPER PROPOSED A NOVEL DISTANCE BASED METHOD FUSING SPARSE REPRESENTATION AND LOCALITY-CONSTRAINED DICTIONARY LEARNING (SRLC-DL) FOR ROBUST LEAF RECOGNITION. INTEGRATING THE DISTANCES OBTAINED BY DICTIONARY LEARNING AND NAIVE SPARSE REPRESENTATION CAN GENERATE ROBUST AND HIGH PERFORMANCE LEAF RECOGNITION. IN THE FUSION OF DISTANCES, THE NUMBER OF ATOMS WAS NOT NECESSARILY LARGE AS CONVENTIONAL METHODS, AND EVEN USING SMALLER ATOMS PRODUCED MORE PROMISING RECOGNITION AT TIMES. THEREFORE, NOT ONLY HAS THE LEAF RECOGNITION ACCURACY BY SPARSE REPRESENTATION BEEN ADVANCED, BUT THE RECOGNITION SPEED ALSO REMAINS FAST ENOUGH. A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS HAD BEEN CONDUCTED ON FIVE BENCHMARK LEAF DATASETS, INCLUDING CALTECH LEAVES, LEAF, HERBARIUM, SWEDISH LEAF AND FLAVIA. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT SRLC-DL PRODUCED A HIGHER ACCURACY IN LEAF IMAGE RECOGNITION AND OUTPERFORMED MANY OTHER STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS.

WHEN THERE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT COLORS, SUCH AS RED, GREEN AND BLUE, BETWEEN PLANT TARGET AND BACKGROUND, CLASSICAL IMAGE PROCESSING METHODS ARE UP TO THE TASK. HOWEVER, IN NEAR COLOR SCENE, FOR EXAMPLE DARK GREEN TARGET AND BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND, PLANT TARGET RECOGNITION IS STILL A VERY CHALLENGING TASK. TO SEGMENT PLANTS IN ABOVE SCENE, THE NEAR COLOR RECOGNITION METHOD BASED ON RESIDUAL VECTOR AND SVM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. FIRSTLY, THE COLOR VECTORS WERE PROJECTED TO THE PLANE THAT CROSSES THE POINT ORIGIN(0, 0, 0) AND IS PERPENDICULAR TO REFERENCE COLOR VECTOR B0(255, 255, 255). AFTER PROJECTION, THE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT COLOR VECTORS WERE DISTRIBUTED IN DIFFERENT POLAR ANGLE RANGES, WHILE THE NEAR COLOR VECTORS WERE CONCENTRATED IN THE SAME POLAR ANGLE RANGE. FOR NEAR COLOR VECTORS, THE SMALL POLAR ANGLE DIFFERENCE, NAMELY ROLL, WAS REGARDED AS REDUNDANT INFORMATION. THEN, THE ANGLE Î˜ BETWEEN TARGET COLOR VECTOR A(R, G, B)Â AND B0, ALONG WITH THE NORM OF A, NAMELY â€– A â†’ â€– WAS CALCULATED.

"ZHANG S;CHAU K";DIMENSION REDUCTION USING SEMISUPERVISED LOCALLY LINEAR EMBEDDING FOR PLANT LEAF CLASSIFICATION;PLANT HAS PLENTY USE IN FOODSTUFF, MEDICINE AND INDUSTRY, AND IS ALSO VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. SO, IT IS IMPORTANT AND URGENT TO RECOGNIZE AND CLASSIFY PLANT SPECIES. PLANT CLASSIFICATION BASED ON LEAF IMAGES IS A BASIC RESEARCH OF BOTANICAL AREA AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. DUE TO THE HIGH NATURE COMPLEXITY AND HIGH DIMENSIONALITY OF LEAF IMAGE DATA, DIMENSIONAL REDUCTION ALGORITHMS ARE USEFUL AND NECESSARY FOR SUCH TYPE OF DATA ANALYSIS, SINCE IT CAN FACILITATE FAST CLASSIFYING PLANTS, AND UNDERSTANDING AND MANAGING PLANT LEAF FEATURES. SUPERVISED LOCALLY LINEAR EMBEDDING (SLLE) IS A POWERFUL FEATURE EXTRACTION METHOD, WHICH CAN YIELD VERY PROMISING RECOGNITION RESULTS WHEN COUPLED WITH SOME SIMPLE CLASSIFIERS. IN THIS PAPER, A SEMI-SLLE IS PROPOSED AND IS APPLIED TO PLANT CLASSIFICATION BASED ON LEAF IMAGES. THE EXPERIMENT RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM PERFORMS VERY WELL ON LEAF IMAGE DATA WHICH EXHIBITS A MANIFOLD STRUCTURE.

"ZHANG S;WU X;YOU Z";JACCARD DISTANCE BASED WEIGHTED SPARSE REPRESENTATION FOR COARSETOFINE PLANT SPECIES RECOGNITION;LEAF BASED PLANT SPECIES RECOGNITION PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN ECOLOGICAL PROTECTION, HOWEVER ITS APPLICATION TO LARGE AND MODERN LEAF DATABASES HAS BEEN A LONG-STANDING OBSTACLE DUE TO THE COMPUTATIONAL COST AND FEASIBILITY. RECOGNIZING SUCH LIMITATIONS, WE PROPOSE A JACCARD DISTANCE BASED SPARSE REPRESENTATION (JDSR) METHOD WHICH ADOPTS A TWO-STAGE, COARSE TO FINE STRATEGY FOR PLANT SPECIES RECOGNITION. IN THE FIRST STAGE, WE USE THE JACCARD DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TEST SAMPLE AND EACH TRAINING SAMPLE TO COARSELY DETERMINE THE CANDIDATE CLASSES OF THE TEST SAMPLE. THE SECOND STAGE INCLUDES A JACCARD DISTANCE BASED WEIGHTED SPARSE REPRESENTATION BASED CLASSIFICATION(WSRC), WHICH AIMS TO APPROXIMATELY REPRESENT THE TEST SAMPLE IN THE TRAINING SPACE, AND CLASSIFY IT BY THE APPROXIMATION RESIDUALS. SINCE THE TRAINING MODEL OF OUR JDSR METHOD INVOLVES MUCH FEWER BUT MORE INFORMATIVE REPRESENTATIVES, THIS METHOD IS EXPECTED TO OVERCOME THE LIMITATION OF HIGH COMPUTATIONAL AND MEMORY COSTS IN TRADITIONAL SPARSE REPRESENTATION BASED CLASSIFICATION. COMPARATIVE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ON A PUBLIC LEAF IMAGE DATABASE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE PROPOSED METHOD OUTPERFORMS OTHER EXISTING FEATURE EXTRACTION AND SRC BASED PLANT RECOGNITION METHODS IN TERMS OF BOTH ACCURACY AND COMPUTATIONAL SPEED.

"ZHANG S;ZHANG C;WANG Z;KONG W";COMBINING SPARSE REPRESENTATION AND SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION FOR PLANT RECOGNITION;PLANT RECOGNITION IS ONE OF IMPORTANT RESEARCH AREAS OF PATTERN RECOGNITION. AS PLANT LEAVES ARE EXTREMELY IRREGULAR, COMPLEX AND DIVERSE, MANY EXISTING PLANT CLASSIFICATION AND RECOGNITION METHODS CANNOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE AUTOMATIC PLANT RECOGNITION SYSTEM. A PLANT RECOGNITION APPROACH IS PROPOSED BY COMBINING SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION (SVD) AND SPARSE REPRESENTATION (SR) IN THIS PAPER. THE DIFFERENCE FROM THE TRADITIONAL PLANT CLASSIFICATION METHODS IS THAT, INSTEAD OF ESTABLISHING A CLASSIFICATION MODEL BY EXTRACTING THE CLASSIFICATION FEATURES, THE PROPOSED METHOD DIRECTLY REDUCES THE IMAGE DIMENSIONALITY AND RECOGNIZES THE TEST SAMPLES BASED ON THE SPARSE COEFFICIENTS, AND USES THE CLASS-SPECIFIC DICTIONARY LEARNING FOR SPARSE MODELING TO REDUCE THE RECOGNITION TIME. THE PROPOSED METHOD IS VERIFIED ON TWO PLANT LEAF DATASETS AND IS COMPARED WITH OTHER FOUR EXISTING PLANT RECOGNITION METHODS THE OVERALL RECOGNITION ACCURACY OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH FOR THE 6 KINDS OF PLANT LEAVES IS OVER 96%, WHICH IS THE BEST CLASSIFICATION RATE.

MOST OF THE PRIOR RESEARCH USING VISIBLE AND NEAR INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY FOR PLANT IDENTIFICATION HAVE BEEN LIMITED IN SCOPE TO PLANTS GROWN UNDER A SINGLE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION. THIS WORK STUDIED THE IMPACTS OF VARIATIONS IN DIURNAL GROWING TEMPERATURE RANGE ON HYPERSPECTRAL FEATURES IN THE VISIBLE AND NEAR INFRARED REGION WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON SPECIES IDENTIFICATION AND HIGH-RESOLUTION MAPPING. SIX MAJOR CALIFORNIAN PROCESSING TOMATO CULTIVARS, BLACK NIGHTSHADE (SOLANUM NIGRUM L.) AND RED-ROOT PIGWEED (AMARANTHUS RETROFLEXUS L.) WERE GROWN UNDER A VARIETY OF DIURNAL TEMPERATURE RANGES SIMULATING THE RANGE COMMON IN THE CALIFORNIAN SPRINGTIME PLANTING PERIOD AND ONE TREATMENT SIMULATING GREENHOUSE GROWING CONDITIONS. THE PRINCIPAL CHANGE IN CANOPY REFLECTANCE WITH CHANGING TEMPERATURE OCCURRED IN THE 480-670 NM AND 695-795 NM REGIONS. A SPECIES-TEMPERATURE INTERACTION EFFECT BETWEEN TOMATO AND BLACK NIGHTSHADE WAS OBSERVED IN THE PERFORMANCE OF A SPECIES CLASSIFIER BASED UPON THE FULL 400-795 NM RANGE. A BILATERALLY SYMMETRIC ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE CLASSIFICATION RATES OF THESE TWO SPECIES OCCURRED WHEN THE CLASSIFICATION MODELS WERE APPLIED TO PLANTS GROWN UNDER A DIURNAL TEMPERATURE RANGE DIFFERENT FROM THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE TRAINING PLANTS WERE GROWN.

THE TASK WAS TO LOCATE THE TREES IN AN AERIAL IMAGE AND PREDICT THEIR FAMILY, GENUS, AND SPECIES. FOR TREE DETECTION, WE APPLIED VARIOUS SUPERVISED LEARNING METHODS WITH LABELED TRAINING DATA AS WELL AS SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING METHODS WITH THE ADDITION OF UNLABELED DATA. OUR EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING METHOD OUTPERFORMED THE SUPERVISED LEARNING METHODS, IMPROVING THE F1-SCORE BY AN AVERAGE OF THREE PERCENT ON THE SET OF IMAGES USED IN THE FINAL PLANT CHALLENGE COMPETITION. FOR TREE CLASSIFICATION, WE APPLIED VARIOUS MACHINE LEARNING METHODS AND DEEP LEARNING MODELS FOR IMAGE CLASSIFICATION TO PREDICT FAMILY, GENUS AND SPECIES ON THE PORTIONS OF IMAGES DETECTED OF TREES BY THE DETECTION MODELS. BY CONSIDERING THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FAMILY, GENUS AND SPECIES, WE DEVELOPED A MULTI-HEAD RESNET18-BASED NEURAL NETWORK AND INCREASED MEAN ACCURACY BY TWO PERCENT OVER THE BASELINE RESNET18.

"ZHAO Z;HONG Y;ZHENG P;WU X";PLANT IDENTIFICATION USING TRIANGULAR REPRESENTATION BASED ON SALIENT POINTS AND MARGIN POINTS;LEAF CLASSIFICATION IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF LIVING PLANT IDENTIFICATION. A LEAF CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PLANT SPECIES IDENTIFICATION IN SPITE OF ITS COMPLEXITY. THIS PAPER INTRODUCES A METHOD OF RECOGNIZING LEAF IMAGES BASED ON TRIANGULAR REPRESENTATIONS. A LEAF IS REPRESENTED BY LOCAL DESCRIPTORS ASSOCIATED WITH MARGIN SAMPLE POINTS AND SALIENT SAMPLE POINTS. WE INTRODUCE THREE NEW TRIANGULAR REPRESENTATIONS - SALIENT TRIANGLE AREA REPRESENTATION (STAR), SALIENT TRIANGLE SIDE LENGTHS REPRESENTATION (STSL), AND SALIENT TRIANGLE AREA, SIDE LENGTHS AND TWO ANGLES REPRESENTATION (STASLA), AND THEN WE COMBINE TWO LOCAL DESCRIPTORS - ONE PROVIDES A TRIANGULAR REPRESENTATION OF THE LEAF MARGIN WHILE THE OTHER REPRESENTS THE SPATIAL CORRELATION BETWEEN SALIENT POINTS OF THE LEAF AND LEAF MARGIN.

"KALA J;SHABAT A;ADETIBA E;AKANLE M";HYBRID LEAF RECOGNITION MODEL FOR PLANT CLASSIFICATION USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK CRAFTED FEATURES;THE RECOGNITION OF PLANTS SPECIES BASED ON LEAF CHARACTERIZATION IS ONE OF THE FIRST APPROACHES USED FOR THE DESIGN OF PLANTS TAXONOMY. THE SHAPE IS THE MOST USED CHARACTERISTIC OF PLANT LEAF AND IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE A STABLE FEATURE WHEN USED FOR THE RECOGNITION OF PLANT SPECIES, USING LEAF IMAGE. CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK(CNN) DESIGN IS INSPIRED FROM THE HUMAN BRAIN, IT HAS BEEN USED FOR OBJECT RECOGNITION WITH SUCCESS. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE APPLICATION OF CNN TO IMPROVE THE RECOGNITION PROCESS OF PLANT SPECIES USING LEAF IMAGES. TO ACHIEVE THIS, A MODEL BASED ON THE COMBINATION OF VARIOUS IMPLEMENTATIONS OF CNN WITH OTHER CLASSIFIERS SUCH AS LOGISTIC REGRESSION CLASSIFIER IS PROPOSED. THE CNN IN THE PROPOSED MODEL IS USED FOR FEATURES EXTRACTION AND THE SELECTED CLASSIFIER IS USED FOR RECOGNITION. IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THIS MODEL, TWO EXPERIMENTS WERE CONDUCTED USING FLAVIA AND LEAFSNAP LEAF IMAGE DATASETS.

"ZHAO Y;ZHENG Y;SHI H;ZHANG L";TRANSFER LEARNINGBASED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK IMAGE RECOGNITION METHOD FOR PLANT LEAVES;TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF PLANT LEAF IMAGE RECOGNITION WITH A SMALL DATASET OF PLANT LEAVES, A CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) PLANT LEAF IMAGE RECOGNITION METHOD BASED ON TRANSFER LEARNING IS PROPOSED. FIRST, A PLANT LEAF IMAGE DATABASE WAS EXPANDED BY PRE-PROCESSING THE ORIGINAL PLANT LEAF IMAGES THROUGH RANDOM HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL ROTATION AND RANDOM ZOOMING. THE EXPANDED DATASET WAS THEN PROCESSED BY MEAN REMOVAL AND DIVIDED INTO TRAINING AND TESTING SETS AT A RATIO OF 4:1. SECOND, TRANSFER LEARNING TRAINING WAS PERFORMED ON THE PLANT LEAF DATASET USING EXISTING MODELS (ALEXNET AND INCEPTIONV3) THAT WERE PRE-TRAINED ON A LARGE DATASET. TO ENSURE THESE MODELS CAN BE ADAPTED TO IMAGE RECOGNITION FOR PLANT LEAVES, THE ORIGINAL PARAMETERS OF THE LAST FULLY CONNECTED LAYER WERE REPLACED, WHEREAS THOSE OF ALL OTHER CONVOLUTION LAYERS WERE RETAINED. FINALLY, THE METHOD PROPOSED IN THIS PAPER WAS COMPARED TO SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE, DEEP BELIEF NETWORK, AND CNN THROUGH TESTING ON THE ICL DATABASE. A TENSORFLOW TRAINING NETWORK MODEL WAS USED IN THE COMPARISON TEST, AND THE RESULTS WERE VISUALIZED BY TENSORBOARD. THE TESTING RESULTS SHOWED A CONSIDERABLE IMPROVEMENT IN RECOGNITION ACCURACY WHEN USING THE PRE-TRAINED ALEXNET AND INCEPTIONV3 MODELS, WHERE THE TRAINING DATASET ACCURACIES WERE 95.31% AND 95.4%, RESPECTIVELY.

THE MODERN CULTIVATED WHEAT SPECIES ORIGINATED FROM THREE WILD DIPLOID ANCESTORS AS A RESULT OF SEVERAL ROUNDS OF GENOME DOUBLING AND ARE REPRESENTED BY DI-, TETRA- AND HEXAPLOID SPECIES. THE IDENTIFICATION OF WHEAT PLOIDY LEVEL IS ONE OF THE MAIN STAGES OF THEIR TAXONOMY. SUCH CLASSIFICATION IS POSSIBLE BASED ON VISUAL ANALYSIS OF THE WHEAT SPIKE TRAITS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SPIKES FOR HEXA- AND TETRAPLOID WHEAT SPECIES BASED ON THE METHOD OF HIGH-PERFORMANCE PHENOTYPING. PHENOTYPING OF THE QUANTITATIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SPIKE OF 17 WHEAT SPECIES (595 PLANTS, 3348 IMAGES), INCLUDING EIGHT TETRAPLOIDS (TRITICUM AETHIOPICUM, T. DICOCCOIDES, T. DICOCCUM, T.

WHEAT SPIKE MORPHOLOGY WAS DESCRIBED ON THE BASIS OF NINE QUANTITATIVE TRAITS INCLUDING SHAPE, SIZE AND AWNS AREA OF THE SPIKE. THE TRAITS WERE OBTAINED AS A RESULT OF IMAGE ANALYSIS USING THE WERECOGNIZER PROGRAM. A CLUSTER ANALYSIS OF PLANTS ACCORDING TO THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SPIKE SHAPE AND COMPARISON OF THEIR DISTRIBUTIONS IN TETRAPLOID AND HEXAPLOID SPECIES SHOWED A HIGHER VARIABILITY OF TRAITS IN HEXAPLOID SPECIES COMPARED TO TETRAPLOID ONES. AT THE SAME TIME, THE SPECIES THEMSELVES FORM TWO CLUSTERS IN THE VISUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SPIKE. ONE TYPE IS PREDOMINANTLY HEXAPLOID SPECIES (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE TETRAPLOID, T.

"ZOU J;GATTANI A";COMPUTERASSISTED VISUAL INTERACTIVE RECOGNITION AND ITS PROSPECTS OF IMPLEMENTATION OVER THE INTERNET;"WHEN COMPLETELY AUTOMATED SYSTEMS DON'T YIELD ACCEPTABLE ACCURACY, MANY PRACTICAL PATTERN RECOGNITION SYSTEMS INVOLVE THE HUMAN EITHER AT THE BEGINNING (PRE-PROCESSING) OR TOWARDS THE END (HANDLING REJECTS). WE BELIEVE THAT IT MAY BE MORE USEFUL TO INVOLVE THE HUMAN THROUGHOUT THE RECOGNITION PROCESS RATHER THAN JUST AT THE BEGINNING OR END. WE DESCRIBE A METHODOLOGY OF INTERACTIVE VISUAL RECOGNITION FOR HUMAN-CENTERED LOW-THROUGHPUT APPLICATIONS, COMPUTER ASSISTED VISUAL INTERACTIVE RECOGNITION (CAVIAR), AND DISCUSS THE PROSPECTS OF IMPLEMENTING CAVIAR OVER THE INTERNET. THE NOVELTY OF CAVIAR IS IMAGE-BASED INTERACTION THROUGH A DOMAIN-SPECIFIC PARAMETERIZED GEOMETRICAL MODEL, WHICH REDUCES THE SEMANTIC GAP BETWEEN HUMANS AND COMPUTERS. THE USER MAY INTERACT WITH THE COMPUTER ANYTIME THAT SHE CONSIDERS ITS RESPONSE UNSATISFACTORY. THE INTERACTION IMPROVES THE ACCURACY OF THE CLASSIFICATION FEATURES BY IMPROVING THE FIT OF THE COMPUTER-PROPOSED MODEL. THE COMPUTER MAKES SUBSEQUENT USE OF THE PARAMETERS OF THE IMPROVED MODEL TO REFINE NOT ONLY ITS OWN STATISTICAL MODEL-FITTING PROCESS, BUT ALSO ITS INTERNAL CLASSIFIER. THE CAVIAR METHODOLOGY WAS APPLIED TO IMPLEMENT A FLOWER RECOGNITION SYSTEM. THE PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS FROM THE EVALUATION OF THE SYSTEM INCLUDE: 1) THE AVERAGE RECOGNITION TIME OF THE CAVIAR SYSTEM IS SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTER THAN THAT OF THE UNAIDED HUMAN, 2) ITS ACCURACY IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE UNAIDED MACHINE; 3) IT CAN BE INITIALIZED WITH AS FEW AS ONE TRAINING SAMPLE PER CLASS AND STILL ACHIEVE HIGH ACCURACY; AND 4) IT DEMONSTRATES A SELF-LEARNING ABILITY. WE HAVE ALSO IMPLEMENTED A MOBILE CAVIAR SYSTEM, WHERE A POCKET PC, AS A CLIENT, CONNECTS TO A SERVER THROUGH WIRELESS COMMUNICATION. THE MOTIVATION BEHIND A MOBILE PLATFORM FOR CAVIAR IS TO APPLY THE METHODOLOGY IN A HUMAN-CENTERED PERVASIVE ENVIRONMENT, WHERE THE USER CAN SEAMLESSLY INTERACT WITH THE SYSTEM FOR CLASSIFYING FIELD-DATA. DEPLOYING CAVIAR TO A NETWORKED MOBILE PLATFORM POSES THE CHALLENGE OF CLASSIFYING FIELD IMAGES AND PROGRAMMING UNDER CONSTRAINTS OF DISPLAY SIZE, NETWORK BANDWIDTH, PROCESSOR SPEED, AND MEMORY SIZE. EDITING OF THE COMPUTER-PROPOSED MODEL IS PERFORMED ON THE HANDHELD WHILE STATISTICAL MODEL FITTING AND CLASSIFICATION TAKE PLACE ON THE SERVER. THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE USER CAN EASILY TAKE SEVERAL PHOTOS OF THE OBJECT POSES AN INTERESTING INFORMATION FUSION PROBLEM. THE ADVANTAGE OF THE INTERNET IS THAT THE PATTERNS IDENTIFIED BY DIFFERENT USERS CAN BE POOLED TOGETHER TO BENEFIT ALL PEER USERS. WHEN USERS IDENTIFY PATTERNS WITH CAVIAR IN A NETWORKED SETTING, THEY ALSO COLLECT TRAINING SAMPLES AND PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MACHINE LEARNING FROM THEIR INTERVENTION. CAVIAR IMPLEMENTED OVER THE INTERNET PROVIDES A PERFECT TEST BED FOR, AND EXTENDS, THE CONCEPT OF OPEN MIND INITIATIVE PROPOSED BY DAVID STORK. OUR EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION FOCUSES ON HUMAN TIME, MACHINE AND HUMAN ACCURACY, AND MACHINE LEARNING. WE DEVOTED MUCH EFFORT TO EVALUATING THE USE OF OUR IMAGE-BASED USER INTERFACE AND ON DEVELOPING PRINCIPLES FOR THE EVALUATION OF INTERACTIVE PATTERN RECOGNITION SYSTEM.

LEAF VEIN EXTRACTION IS ONE OF THE KEY STEPS IN PLANT MODELING AND PLANT RECOGNITION. SEVERAL METHODS HAVE BEEN PRESENTED ON LEAF VEIN EXTRACTION BUT ALL OF THEM ARE LIMITED IN NARROW APPLICATION FIELDS. IN THIS PAPER A UNIVERSAL METHOD IS PROPOSED USING HUE AND INTENSITY INFORMATION. ACCORDING TO THE COLOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LEAF VEIN AND MESOPHYLL, LEAVES ARE CLASSIFIED AS THE CONTRASTING COLOR LEAF AND THE CONCOLOROUS LEAF. LEAF VEIN OF THE CONTRASTING COLOR LEAF CAN BE EXTRACTED USING ONLY HUE INFORMATION. LEAF VEIN EXTRACTION OF THE CONCOLOROUS LEAF NEEDS BOTH HUE AND INTENSITY INFORMATION. THE METHOD HAS BEEN PROGRAMMED UNDER VISUAL C++6.0 AND MANY LEAVES FROM DIFFERENT PLANTS HAVE BEEN TESTED. THE RESULTS SHOW A GOOD APPLICABILITY.

THERE ARE ABOUT 1500 SPECIES OF CHENOPODIACEAE THAT ARE SPREAD WORLDWIDE AND OFTEN ARE ECOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT. BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION OF THESE SPECIES IS CRITICAL DUE TO THE DESTRUCTIVE EFFECTS OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES ON THEM. FOR THIS PURPOSE, IDENTIFICATION AND SURVEILLANCE OF CHENOPODIACEAE SPECIES IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT ARE NECESSARY AND CAN BE FACILITATED BY DEEP LEARNING. THE FEASIBILITY OF APPLYING DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS TO IDENTIFY CHENOPODIACEAE SPECIES DEPENDS ON ACCESS TO THE APPROPRIATE RELEVANT DATASET. THEREFORE, ACHENY DATASET WAS COLLECTED FROM NATURAL HABITATS OF DIFFERENT BUSHES OF CHENOPODIACEAE SPECIES, IN REALWORLD CONDITIONS FROM DESERT AND SEMI-DESERT AREAS OF THE YAZD PROVINCE OF IRAN. THIS IMBALANCED DATASET IS COMPILED OF 27,030 RGB COLOR IMAGES FROM 30 CHENOPODIACEAE SPECIES, EACH SPECIES 300-1461 IMAGES. IMAGING IS PERFORMED FROM MULTIPLE BUSHES FOR EACH SPECIES, WITH DIFFERENT CAMERA-TOTARGET DISTANCES, VIEWPOINTS, ANGLES, AND NATURAL SUNLIGHT IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER. THE COLLECTED IMAGES ARE NOT PREPROCESSED, ONLY ARE RESIZED TO 224 X224 DIMENSIONS WHICH CAN BE USED ON SOME OF THE SUCCESSFUL DEEP LEARNING MODELS AND THEN WERE GROUPED INTO THEIR RESPECTIVE CLASS.

THIS STEMS FROM THE NO FREE LUNCH WHICH STATES THAT UNIVERSAL APPROACH THAT COULD RENDER SATISFYING RESULTS FOR ALL PRACTICAL CHALLENGES DOES NOT EXIST. THEREFORE, IN THIS RESEARCH A NOVEL MULTI-SWARM FIREFLY ALGORITHM, THAT TRIES TO ADDRESS FLAWS OF ORIGINAL FIREFLY METAHEURISTICS, IS PROPOSED. DEVISED ALGORITHM IS APPLIED TO INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT PRACTICAL CHALLENGE OF PLANTS CLASSIFICATION, AS PART OF THE HYBRID FRAMEWORK BETWEEN MACHINE LEARNING AND OPTIMIZATION METAHEURISTICS. FOR THIS PURPOSE, A SET OF 1,000 RANDOM IMAGES OF HEALTHY LEAVES, FROM ONE PUBLIC REPOSITORY, IS RETRIEVED FOR THE FOLLOWING PLANTS: APPLE, CHERRY, PEPPER AND TOMATO. HYBRID FRAMEWORK INCLUDES PRE-PROCESSING, CONSTRUCTING BAG OF FEATURES AND CLASSIFICATION STEPS. AFTER PRE-PROCESSING, A BAG OF FEATURES IS CONSTRUCTED BY UTILIZING WELL-KNOWN SCALE-INVARIANT FEATURE TRANSFORM ALGORITHM, K-MEANS-BASED VOCABULARY GENERATION AND HISTOGRAM. SUCH IMAGES ARE THEN CATEGORIZED WITH SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE CLASSIFIER. HOWEVER, TO OBTAIN SATISFYING RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR DATASET, THE SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES HYPER-PARAMETERS' NEED TO BE TUNED AND IN THE PROPOSED RESEARCH MULTI-SWARM FIREFLY ALGORITHM IS EMPLOYED TO DETERMINE OPTIMAL (SUB-OPTIMAL) HYPER-PARAMETERS' VALUES FOR THIS PRACTICAL CHALLENGE. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WITH THE BASIC FIREFLY METAHEURISTICS AND OTHER WELL-KNOWN SWARM INTELLIGENCE ALGORITHMS WAS CONDUCTED TO ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED METHOD IN TERMS OF PRECISION, RECALL, F-SCORE FOR THIS MULTI-CLASS CLASSIFICATION CHALLENGE.

THIS STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE CAPACITY OF FW LIDAR DATA ALONE FOR TREE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION THROUGH THE INTEGRATION OF WAVEFORM METRICS WITH MACHINE LEARNING METHODS AND BAYESIAN INFERENCE. SPECIFICALLY, WE FIRST CONDUCTED AUTOMATIC TREE SEGMENTATION BASED ON THE WAVEFORM-BASED CANOPY HEIGHT MODEL (CHM) USING THREE APPROACHES INCLUDING TREEVAW, WATERSHED ALGORITHMS AND THE COMBINATION OF TREEVAW AND WATERSHED (TW) ALGORITHMS. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE RANDOM FORESTS (RF) AND CONDITIONAL INFERENCE FORESTS (CF) MODELS WERE EMPLOYED TO IDENTIFY IMPORTANT TREE-LEVEL WAVEFORM METRICS DERIVED FROM THREE DISTINCT SOURCES, SUCH AS RAW WAVEFORMS, COMPOSITE WAVEFORMS, THE WAVEFORM-BASED POINT CLOUD AND THE COMBINED VARIABLES FROM THESE THREE SOURCES. FURTHER, WE DISCRIMINATED TREE (GRAY PINE, BLUE OAK, INTERIOR LIVE OAK) AND SHRUB SPECIES THROUGH THE RF, CF AND BAYESIAN MULTINOMIAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION (BMLR) USING IMPORTANT WAVEFORM METRICS IDENTIFIED IN THIS STUDY. RESULTS OF THE TREE SEGMENTATION DEMONSTRATED THAT THE TW ALGORITHMS OUTPERFORMED OTHER ALGORITHMS FOR DELINEATING INDIVIDUAL TREE CROWNS. THE CF MODEL OVERCOMES WAVEFORM METRICS SELECTION BIAS CAUSED BY THE RF MODEL WHICH FAVORS CORRELATED METRICS AND ENHANCES THE ACCURACY OF SUBSEQUENT CLASSIFICATION. WE ALSO FOUND THAT COMPOSITE WAVEFORMS ARE MORE INFORMATIVE THAN RAW WAVEFORMS AND WAVEFORM-BASED POINT CLOUD FOR CHARACTERIZING TREE SPECIES IN OUR STUDY AREA. BOTH CLASSICAL MACHINE LEARNING METHODS (THE RF AND CF) AND THE BMLR GENERATED SATISFACTORY AVERAGE OVERALL ACCURACY (74% FOR THE RF, 77% FOR THE CF AND 81% FOR THE BMLR) AND THE BMLR SLIGHTLY OUTPERFORMED THE OTHER TWO METHODS. HOWEVER, THESE THREE METHODS SUFFERED FROM LOW INDIVIDUAL CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY FOR THE BLUE OAK WHICH IS PRONE TO BEING MISCLASSIFIED AS THE INTERIOR LIVE OAK DUE TO THE SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS OF BLUE OAK AND INTERIOR LIVE OAK. UNCERTAINTY ESTIMATES FROM THE BMLR METHOD COMPENSATE FOR THIS DOWNSIDE BY PROVIDING CLASSIFICATION RESULTS IN A PROBABILISTIC SENSE AND RENDERING USERS WITH MORE CONFIDENCE IN INTERPRETING AND APPLYING CLASSIFICATION RESULTS TO REAL-WORLD TASKS SUCH AS FOREST INVENTORY.

THERE ARE ABOUT 11 SPECIES OF PISTACHIO THAT OFTEN HAVE A HIGH COMMERCIAL AND ECONOMIC VALUE IN IRAN AND UNITED STATES. THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY PISTACHIO TREE CULTIVARS, DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN THE CHARACTERISTICS/TRAITS OF THESE SPECIES, IS CRUCIAL FOR HARVEST THE OPTIMAL YIELDS, COST REDUCTION, AND DAMAGE PREVENTION. FOR THIS PURPOSE, IDENTIFICATION OF PISTACHIO TREE CULTIVARS IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT IS NECESSARY. THE CULTIVAR IDENTIFICATION RELYING ON ITS APPEARANCE IS A CHALLENGING VISION TASK AND CAN BE FACILITATED BY DEEP LEARNING. THE FEASIBILITY OF APPLYING DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS TO IDENTIFY PISTACHIO TREE CULTIVARS DEPENDS ON ACCESS TO THE APPROPRIATE RELEVANT DATASET. THEREFORE, ICPTC DATASET WAS COLLECTED FROM NATURAL HABITATS OF DIFFERENT TREES OF PISTACHIO CULTIVARS, IN REAL-WORLD CONDITIONS FROM PISTACHIO ORCHARD FARMS OF CHAH-AFZAL REGION IN ARDAKAN COUNTY, YAZD, IRAN. THIS IMBALANCED DATASET IS COMPILED OF 526 RGB COLOR IMAGES FROM 4 PISTACHIO TREE CULTIVARS, EACH CULTIVAR 109-171 IMAGES. THE TREE OF IRANIAN COMMERCIAL PISTACHIO CULTIVARS, WITH NAMES LIKE JUMBO (KALLE-GHUCHI), LONG (AHMAD-AGHAEI), ROUND (O'HADI), AND SUPER-LONG (AKBARI) HAVE DISTINCTIVE BRANCH EXPANSION, LEAF PATTERNS, LEAF SHAPES AND COLORS.

THE ADDITION OF INTELLIGENCE INTO VISION SYSTEMS REQUIRES AN UNDERSTANDING AND STRUCTURING OF HUMAN VISUAL AND SCENE INTERPRETATION TECHNIQUES. THIS RESEARCH INVESTIGATED THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS AND COMBINED THE AREAS OF FEATURE EXTRACTION, PATTERN RECOGNITION AND TECHNIQUES OF SCENE INTERPRETATION BY HUMANS. THE RESEARCH IS ESPECIALLY UNIQUE IN ITS RULE-BASED STRUCTURING OF SUBJECTIVE, QUALITATIVE, HUMAN-LEVEL SHAPE FEATURES AND QUANTITATIVE MACHINE-LEVEL SHAPE FEATURES.

EXCESS GREEN CLASSIFIED PLANT AND SOIL REGIONS CORRECTLY OVER THE ENTIRE THREE-WEEK OBSERVATION PERIOD WITH HIGH ACCURACIES (99\% PLUS). PLANT AND SOIL BINARY IMAGES WERE DERIVED FROM EXCESS GREEN IMAGES AND PROVIDED EDGE BOUNDARIES. THESE BOUNDARIES WERE USED WITH CORRESPONDING GRAY SCALE IMAGES TO EXTRACT FOUR CLASSICAL TEXTURAL FEATURES FOR PLANTS AND SOIL: ANGULAR SECOND MOMENT, INERTIA, ENTROPY, AND LOCAL HOMOGENEITY. THESE FEATURES WERE DERIVED FROM THE CO-OCCURRENCE MATRIX. STEPWISE AND CANONICAL DISCRIMINANT ANALYSES WERE USED TO TEST THE CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE OF THE TEXTURE AND EXCESS GREEN FEATURES.

"CARLEY S;PRICE S";ANALYZING A HUMANINTHELOOPS DECISIONS FOR THE DETECTION OF DATA POISONING;HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP (HITL) IS THE PROCESS OF COMBINING THE POWER OF A MACHINE OR COMPUTER SYSTEM AND HUMAN INTELLIGENCE TO DEVELOP HUMAN-AWARE MACHINE LEARNING (ML) MODELS. THE HITL PROCESS CREATES A CONTINUOUS FEEDBACK LOOP BETWEEN HUMAN AND MACHINE, ENABLING THE TRAINED MODEL TO CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE AS EDGE CASES PRESENT THEMSELVES WITHOUT THE NEED TO FINE-TUNE THE MODEL FROM SCRATCH. SEVERAL ADVANTAGES OF UTILIZING HITL ML SYSTEMS ARE TO AVOID BIAS, ENSURE CONSISTENCY AND ACCURACY, IMPROVE EFFICIENCY, AND PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY. HOWEVER, ADDING HUMAN INVOLVEMENT ALSO INVITES HUMAN MISTAKES. OCCASIONALLY, A HITL SYSTEM MAY ACTUALLY DEGRADE THE ALGORITHM RATHER THAN IMPROVE IT: MISLABELING AN OBJECT IN AN OBJECT DETECTION ALGORITHM, INCORRECTLY SCORING AN ALGORITHM'S OUTPUT, MAKING MISCLICKS AND TYPOS, AND OTHER HUMAN ERRORS CAUSE THE HITL TO MAKE A MISTAKE BASED ON THE FACTS PRESENTED TO IT. THESE ERRORS BEING MADE BY THE USER, INTENTIONAL OR NOT, CAN BE CONSIDERED A FORM OF DATA POISONING. TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF A HITL'S CHOICES ON AN ML MODEL, SEVERAL PIECES OF INFORMATION DURING THE HITL PROCESS CAN BE OBSERVED, I.E.,: THE TIME TAKEN BY THE USER TO PROVIDE INPUT ON AN OUTPUT OR ON A SPECIFIC OBJECT CLASS, AS WELL AS AN EVALUATION OF THE CONSISTENCY OF SUBMITTED VALID INPUTS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS. INFORMATION EXTRACTED FROM THE HITL'S DECISION-MAKING PROCESS CAN PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO WHETHER POOR CHOICES ARE BEING MADE BY THE USER (I.E., DATA POISONING) AND IDENTIFY WHERE, WHEN, AND WHY THESE CHOICES ARE BEING MADE. MANY STATE-OF-THE-ART MODELS CAN BE UTILIZED FOR THIS WORK, SUCH AS RESNET-50, DARKNET-53, XCEPTION, AMONG OTHERS.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ZERNIKE MOMENT INVARIANT (ZMI), LEGENDRE MOMENT INVARIANT (LMI) AND TCHEBICHEF MOMENT INVARIANT (TMI) FEATURES IN EXTRACTING FEATURES FROM LEAF IMAGES. THEN, THE FEATURES EXTRACTED FROM THE MOST EFFECTIVE MOMENT INVARIANT TECHNIQUE ARE CLASSIFIED USING THE GENERAL REGRESSION NEURAL NETWORK (GRNN). THERE ARE TWO MAIN STAGES INVOLVED IN PLANT LEAF IDENTIFICATION. THE FIRST STAGE IS KNOWN AS FEATURE EXTRACTION PROCESS WHERE MOMENT INVARIANT METHODS ARE APPLIED. THE OUTPUT OF THIS PROCESS IS A SET OF A GLOBAL VECTOR FEATURE THAT REPRESENTS THE SHAPE OF THE LEAF IMAGES. IT IS SHOWN THAT TMI CAN EXTRACT VECTOR FEATURE WITH PERCENTAGE OF ABSOLUTE ERROR (PAE) LESS THAN 10.38 PERCENT. THEREFORE, TMI VECTOR FEATURE WILL BE THE INPUT TO THE SECOND STAGE. THE SECOND STAGE INVOLVES CLASSIFICATION OF LEAF IMAGES BASED ON THE DERIVED FEATURE GAINED IN THE PREVIOUS STAGE.

HOWEVER; WHEN A LIMITED RANGE OF THE DATA WAS CONSIDERED, MUCH LOWER CORRELATIONS RESULTED, REVEALING A LOSS OF SPATIAL COLOR RESOLUTION DUE TO THE TRANSMISSION OF THE VIDEO SIGNAL. THE MEAN EXECUTION TIME OF THE ASA WAS 0.038 S FOR 0.91 M (3 FT) LONG INTER-ROW REGIONS SHOWING THAT THE ALGORITHM MET THE REAL-TIME CONSTRAINTS NECESSARY TO BE USED AS A SENSING SYSTEM FOR A VARIABLE-RATE HERBICIDE APPLICATOR.";"IMAGE PROCESSING; SENSING SYSTEM; ADAPTIVE TECHNIQUES; WEED CONTROL;; SITE-SPECIFIC CROP MANAGEMENT";"SOYBEAN GLYCINE-MAX; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; PLANT-IDENTIFICATION; DIGITAL; IMAGES; FIELDS; SEEDLINGS; LEAVES; COLOR";TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE;27;1999;ENGLISH;ARTICLE;NA
